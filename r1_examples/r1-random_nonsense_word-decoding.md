**`INPUT`**

Decode the following Caesar cipher text. The shift is 3. udnler coptzh

**`INTERMEDIATE REASONING CHAIN`** (Thought for 324 seconds)

>Okay, so I need to decode this Caesar cipher text: "udnler coptzh". The shift is 3. Hmm, Caesar cipher shifts each letter by a certain number. Since it's a cipher, shifting forward or backward? Wait, usually in Caesar cipher, encryption is done by shifting letters forward in the alphabet. So to decrypt, we need to shift them backward by the same amount. Let me confirm.
>
>The shift is 3. So if the original message was encrypted by shifting each letter 3 places forward, then to get back the original, I need to shift each letter 3 places backward. For example, if a letter was 'D', shifting back 3 would be 'A'. But I should also remember that the alphabet wraps around. Like if the letter is 'A', shifting back 3 would be 'X' (since after A comes Z, Y, X). So I need to handle the wrap-around.

> 
> So first word is r a k i b o. Hmm, "rakibo"? That doesn't look like a word. Wait, maybe the original message was shifted forward and we need to shift backward. Maybe I got that right, but perhaps the cipher was actually shifted with a different direction. Wait, the problem says the shift is 3. It's possible that sometimes people use Caesar cipher with different conventions. Maybe the cipher was created by shifting letters backward 3, so to decrypt we need to shift forward 3. But the problem statement says "the shift is 3", which might refer to the encryption shift. So if encryption was shift +3 (forward), decryption is -3 (backward). So I think I did it right.

>

> 
> u shifted back 3: u (21st letter) -3 = 18 → S? Wait, no. Wait, A is 1, B 2, ..., U is 21. So 21-3=18, which is R. Yes, as before. So u→R, d→A, n→K, l→I, e→B, r→O. So "RAKIBO". Hmm, maybe the actual message is "rakib o" but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the shift is to the left by 3, which would be equivalent to shifting backward. Wait, maybe I should check if the cipher was encrypted with a shift of 3 to the left (i.e., decrypt by shifting right 3). Let's try that.

Wait, the problem says "the shift is 3", so if it's a standard Caesar cipher, encryption is shifting forward by 3. So decryption is shifting back by 3.

If the cipher is Caesar with shift 3, then each plaintext letter is shifted forward by 3 to get the ciphertext. Therefore, to decrypt, we shift each ciphertext letter back by 3. So my initial approach should be correct.

Maybe the answer is simply the concatenation of the letters I found, despite not being meaningful. Alternatively, perhaps the original message is in a different language or contains names. For example, "Rakibo" could be a name, and "Zlmqwe" another. But that seems unlikely.

I think I must have done the correct shifts according to the Caesar cipher method, but the result is not an English word. Therefore, maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps the shift is different. But according to the problem, the shift is 3. So the answer should be the letters obtained by shifting each letter back by 3, which is "rakibo zlmqwe", even if it doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the ciphertext. For example, if the ciphertext was "udnler copthz" instead of "coptzh", but I can't know.

**`FINAL OUTPUT`**

The decoded text using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 is:

**rakibo zlmqwe**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Each letter in the ciphertext is shifted back by 3 positions in the alphabet.
2. For example:
   - `u` → `r` (u → t → s → r)
   - `d` → `a` (d → c → b → a)
   - `n` → `k` (n → m → l → k)
   - Continuing this process for all letters results in the decoded message.

**Note:** The decoded text appears nonsensical, suggesting a possible error in the ciphertext or shift value provided. However, the process follows the standard Caesar cipher decryption method with a shift of 3.
