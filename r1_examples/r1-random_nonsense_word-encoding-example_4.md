**`INPUT`**

Encode the following text to a Caesar cipher. The shift is 3. rakibo zlmqwe

**`INTERMEDIATE REASONING CHAIN`** (Thought for 44 seconds)

Okay, let's tackle this Caesar cipher problem. The user wants to encode the text "rakibo zlmqwe" with a shift of 3. Alright, first, I need to remember how Caesar ciphers work. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. In this case, the shift is 3, so every letter moves 3 positions forward.

But wait, I need to make sure about the direction. Caesar ciphers typically shift to the right in the alphabet. So, for example, A becomes D with a shift of 3. Let me confirm that. Yes, shifting forward by 3. So if the letter is near the end, like X, Y, Z, it should wrap around. X would become A, Y becomes B, Z becomes C. That's correct.

Now, the text to encode is "rakibo zlmqwe". Let me break it down letter by letter. Let's start with the first letter 'r'. The alphabet positions: a=0, b=1, ..., z=25. But maybe it's easier to count positions. Let's list the alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z. Wait, but we're dealing with lowercase letters here. The case might not matter, but since the original is lowercase, maybe the cipher should also be lowercase. The user didn't specify, but probably expects lowercase.

So 'r' is the 18th letter (if a=0, then r is 17, since a=0, b=1,... r=17). Wait, maybe it's better to think a=1, b=2, ..., z=26. But in programming terms, often modulo 26 is used with 0-25. Hmm. Let me clarify. Let's assign each letter a number from 0 to 25. So a=0, b=1, ..., z=25. Then, for each letter, we compute (original + shift) mod 26, then convert back to a letter.

So 'r' is 17. 17 +3 =20, which is 'u'. Next letter 'a' (0) becomes 0+3=3, which is 'd'. Then 'k' is 10, +3=13, which is 'n'. 'i' is 8, +3=11, 'l'. 'b' is 1, +3=4, 'e'. 'o' is 14, +3=17, 'r'. So "rakibo" becomes "udnler".

Now the space: the user included a space in the input. Caesar ciphers typically leave non-alphabetic characters as is, so the space remains a space.

Now the second part: "zlmqwe". Let's process each letter. 'z' is 25. 25 +3=28. 28 mod 26 is 2, which is 'c'. 'l' is 11, +3=14, 'o'. 'm' is 12, +3=15, 'p'. 'q' is 16, +3=19, 't'. 'w' is 22, +3=25, 'z'. 'e' is 4, +3=7, 'h'. So "zlmqwe" becomes "copthz".

Putting it all together: "udnler copthz".

Wait, let me double-check each letter to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First part:

r (17) → 20 → u

a (0) → 3 → d

k (10) → 13 → n

i (8) → 11 → l

b (1) → 4 → e

o (14) → 17 → r

So "udnler" is correct.

Second part:

z (25) → 25+3=28 mod26=2 → c

l (11) → 14 → o

m (12) →15 → p

q (16) →19 → t

w (22) →25 → z

e (4) →7 → h

So "copthz" is correct.

Combined with the space: "udnler copthz". That should be the correct ciphertext. Let me just check once more for any possible errors. Especially the wrap-around for 'z' which becomes 'c', and 'w' to 'z', which is correct. Yes, looks right. So the final answer is udnler copthz.

**`FINAL OUTPUT`**

The encoded text using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 is:

**udnler copthz**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Each letter in "rakibo zlmqwe" is shifted 3 positions forward in the alphabet.
2. Non-alphabetic characters (like the space) remain unchanged.
3. Letters wrap around if they go past 'z' (e.g., 'z' → 'c', 'w' → 'z').

**Result:**  
`udnler copthz`
