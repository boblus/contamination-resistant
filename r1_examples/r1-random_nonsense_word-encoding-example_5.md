**`INPUT`**

Encode the following text to a Caesar cipher. The shift is 3. rakibo zlmqwe

**`INTERMEDIATE REASONING CHAIN`** (Thought for 60 seconds)

Okay, I need to encode the text "rakibo zlmqwe" using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3. Let me start by recalling how the Caesar cipher works. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. In this case, the shift is 3, so each letter should be moved three positions forward.

First, I'll handle the letters one by one. Let's start with the first letter 'r'. The alphabet positions are a=1, b=2, ..., z=26. So 'r' is the 18th letter. Adding 3 gives 21, which is 'u'. That's straightforward.

Next is 'a'. 'a' is 1, plus 3 is 4, which is 'd'. Then 'k' which is 11. 11+3=14, which is 'n'. Then 'i' is 9, plus 3 is 12, so 'l'. Then 'b' is 2, plus 3 is 5, which is 'e'. 'o' is 15, plus 3 is 18, which is 'r'. So "rakibo" becomes "udnelr".

Wait, let me check that again. 'o' is the 15th letter. Adding 3 would make it 18, which is 'r'. That's correct. So the first part is "udnelr".

Now the space remains a space, so that's straightforward. Then the next part is "zlmqwe".

Starting with 'z'. 'z' is 26. Adding 3 would wrap around because 26+3=29. Since the alphabet has 26 letters, 29-26=3, which is 'c'. Then 'l' is 12. 12+3=15, which is 'o'. 'm' is 13, plus 3 is 16, so 'p'. 'q' is 17, plus 3 is 20, which is 't'. 'w' is 23, plus 3 is 26, which is 'z'. 'e' is 5, plus 3 is 8, which is 'h'. Wait, no, wait. The last letter is 'e' in "zlmqwe". Let me confirm each letter again:

z → c (26 +3=29 → 3)

l → o (12+3=15)

m → p (13+3=16)

q → t (17+3=20)

w → z (23+3=26)

e → h (5+3=8)

So "zlmqwe" becomes "coptzh".

Putting it all together, the original text "rakibo zlmqwe" becomes "udnelr coptzh".

Wait, let me double-check each letter to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through them again:

r → u (18+3=21)

a → d (1+3=4)

k → n (11+3=14)

i → l (9+3=12)

b → e (2+3=5)

o → r (15+3=18)

space remains

z → c (26+3=29 → 3)

l → o (12+3=15)

m → p (13+3=16)

q → t (17+3=20)

w → z (23+3=26)

e → h (5+3=8)

Yes, that seems correct. So the final ciphertext should be "udnelr coptzh".

**`FINAL OUTPUT`**

The encoded text using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 is:

**udnelr coptzh**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Each letter in "rakibo zlmqwe" is shifted 3 positions forward in the alphabet.
2. Letters wrap around from 'z' back to 'a' when necessary.
3. The space remains unchanged.

**Breakdown:**
- r → u
- a → d
- k → n
- i → l
- b → e
- o → r
- (space)
- z → c
- l → o
- m → p
- q → t
- w → z
- e → h
