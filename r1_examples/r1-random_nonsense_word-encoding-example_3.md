**`INPUT`**

Encode the following text to a Caesar cipher. The shift is 3. rakibo zlmqwe

**`INTERMEDIATE REASONING CHAIN`** (Thought for 28 seconds)

Okay, so I need to encode the text "rakibo zlmqwe" using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3. Let me start by recalling how Caesar ciphers work. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, the shift is 3, so each letter should be moved three positions forward.

First, I should handle the letters one by one. Let me write down the alphabet to make it easier: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z. Now, for each letter in "rakibo zlmqwe", I'll shift it by 3. Let's start with the first letter 'r'. R is the 18th letter (if A=1). Adding 3 gives 21, which is 'U'. Next is 'a', which is 1. 1+3=4, so 'D'. Then 'k' is 11, plus 3 is 14, which is 'N'. 'i' is 9, so 9+3=12, which is 'L'. 'b' is 2, adding 3 gives 5, which is 'E'. 'o' is 15, plus 3 is 18, which is 'R'. So the first word "rakibo" becomes "UDNELR".

Now the space stays as is, so we have a space. Then the next part "zlmqwe". Let's do each letter. 'z' is 26. Adding 3 would take it beyond 26, so I need to wrap around. 26+3=29, subtract 26 gives 3, which is 'C'. 'l' is 12, plus 3 is 15, 'O'. 'm' is 13, plus 3 is 16, 'P'. 'q' is 17, plus 3 is 20, 'T'. 'w' is 23, plus 3 is 26, which is 'Z'. 'e' is 5, plus 3 is 8, 'H'. So "zlmqwe" becomes "COPTZH".

Putting it all together: "UDNELR COPTZH". Let me double-check each letter to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

r → u, a→d, k→n, i→l, b→e, o→r. Yes. Then z→c, l→o, m→p, q→t, w→z, e→h. That looks right. I think that's it. Wait, just to confirm the wrap around for 'z' again. z is 26, shift 3: 26 (z) +1= a, +2= b, +3= c. Yep, that's correct. Similarly, 'w' is 23 +3=26 which is z. Correct. Alright, so the final ciphertext should be UDNELR COPTZH.

**`FINAL OUTPUT`**

The encoded text using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 is:

**UDNELR COPTZH**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Caesar Cipher Basics:** Each letter is shifted 3 positions forward in the alphabet.
2. **Process Each Character:**
   - **r** → u (R → U)
   - **a** → d (A → D)
   - **k** → n (K → N)
   - **i** → l (I → L)
   - **b** → e (B → E)
   - **o** → r (O → R)
   - **Space** remains unchanged.
   - **z** → c (Z wraps around to C)
   - **l** → o (L → O)
   - **m** → p (M → P)
   - **q** → t (Q → T)
   - **w** → z (W → Z)
   - **e** → h (E → H)

**Result:** `UDNELR COPTZH`
