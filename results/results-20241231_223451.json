The shift is 12.\nuser\nraxxai kagd tqmdf\nassistant\nTo decode a Caesar cipher with a shift of 12, we need to shift each letter in the encrypted message back by 12 positions in the alphabet.\n\nGiven text: raxxai kagd tqmdf\n\nLet's decode it:\n\n- r -> p (r - 1 = q; q - 1 = p)\n- a -> q (a - 12 wraps around to q)\n- x -> v (x - 12 wraps around to v)\n- x -> v (same as above)\n- a -> q (same as above)\n- i -> g (i - 12 wraps around to g)\n\nSo \"raxxai\" becomes \"pqvvqg\".\n\n- k -> i (k - 12 wraps around to i)\n- a -> q (same as above)\n- g -> e (g - 12 wraps around to e)\n- d -> b (d - 12 wraps around to b)\n\nSo \"kagd\" becomes \"iqeb\".\n\n- t -> r (t - 12 wraps around to r)\n- q -> m (q - 12 wraps around to m)\n- m -> k (m - 12 wraps around to k)\n- d -> b (same as above)\n- f -> d (f - 12 wraps around to d)\n\nSo \"tqmdf\" becomes \"rmkbd\".\n\nPutting it all together, the decoded message is:\n\n**pqvvqg iqeb rmkbd**\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to form meaningful words. Let's recheck the decoding process:\n\n- r -> p (r - 12 = p)\n- a -> q (a - 12 = q)\n- x -> v (x - 12 = v)\n- x -> v (x - 12 = v)\n- a -> q (a - 12 = q)\n- i -> g (i - 12 = g)\n\nSo \"raxxai\" becomes \"pqvvqg\".\n\n- k -> i (k - 12 = i)\n- a -> q (a - 12 = q)\n- g -> e (g - 12 = e)\n- d -> b (d - 12 = b)\n\nSo \"kagd\" becomes \"iqeb\".\n\n- t -> r (t - 12 = r)\n- q -> m (q - 12 = m)\n- m -> k (m - 12 = k)\n- d -> b (d - 12 = b)\n- f -> d (f - 12 = d)\n\nSo \"tqmdf\" becomes \"rmkbd\".\n\nThus, the decoded message is:\n\n**pqvvqg iqeb rmkbd**\n\nIt appears that the original message might not have formed coherent English words even after decryption.",
