Maybe the ciphertext has errors, or perhaps it's not English.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the shift in the other direction. If the shift was 3 forward, then shifting back by 3 would be correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"the shift is 3\", but doesn't specify direction. Maybe it's shifted forward by 3, meaning to decode, shift back by 3.\n\nAlternatively, in Caesar cipher, \"shift 3\" usually means shift forward by 3 positions.\n\nSo, in that case, to decode, shift back by 3 positions, which is what I did.\n\nTherefore, the plaintext is \"opiqwer iuxzqwe klrirq\"\n\nIf this doesn't make sense, perhaps it's a different key or a different cipher.\n\nBut according to the given instructions, this should be the correct plaintext.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{opiqwer iuxzqwe klrirq}} \\]",

Three letters before I is F.\n\nNext, \"l\":\nL is the 12th letter. Three before L is I.\n\nThen, \"r\":\nR is the 18th letter. Three before R is O.\n\nU:\nU is the 21st letter. Three before U is R.\n\nV:\nV is the 22nd letter. Three before V is S.\n\nW:\nW is the 23rd letter. Three before W is T.\n\nSo, \"ilruvw\" decodes to \"fiorts\".\n\nNow, for \"caqytzh\":\n\nC:\nC is the 3rd letter. Three before C is Z.\n\nA:\nA is the 1st letter. Three before A would wrap around to W.\n\nQ:\nQ is the 17th letter. Three before Q is N.\n\nY:\nY is the 25th letter. Three before Y is V.\n\nT:\nT is the 20th letter. Three before T is Q.\n\nZ:\nZ is the 26th letter. Three before Z is W.\n\nH:\nH is the 8th letter. Three before H is E.\n\nSo, \"caqytzh\" decodes to \"wnvqwe\".\n\nPutting it all together, the plaintext is \"fiorts wnvqwe\".\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to make much sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the decoding process. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the alphabet wraps around. For letters near the beginning, like A, shifting back 3 would go to the end of the alphabet.\n\nLet me re-examine \"caqytzh\":\n\nC -> Z (correct)\n\nA -> X (not W; since A is 1, three back would be X, the 24th letter)\n\nQ -> N (correct)\n\nY -> V (correct)\n\nT -> Q (correct)\n\nZ -> W (correct)\n\nH -> E (correct)\n\nSo, \"caqytzh\" should decode to \"znvqwe\".\n\nWait, A to X is correct because A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, so three back from A would actually be W, but let's confirm:\n\nA (1) -3 = position 26 - 3 +1 = 24, which is X. Wait, actually, in modular arithmetic, position = (1 - 3) mod 26 = -2 mod 26 = 24, which is X.\n\nSo, A shifts to X, not W.\n\nTherefore, \"caqytzh\" decodes to \"znvqwe\".\n\nSo, the entire plaintext is \"fiorts znvqwe\".\n\nThis still doesn't make much sense. Maybe the shift is not 3, or perhaps there's a mistake in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 positions forward, not backward.\n\nLet's try shifting forward by 3 positions.\n\nStarting with \"i\":\n\nI shifted forward by 3 is L.\n\nL is 12th letter.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nI -> L\n\nL -> O\n\nR -> U\n\nU -> X\n\nV -> Y\n\nW -> Z\n\nSo, \"ilruvw\" becomes \"loxyyz\".\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nPerhaps the shift is 3 positions back.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alphabet is considered in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ciphertext is not entirely letters, or there are punctuation marks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is different for different parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 3 positions forward.\n\nWait, the original instruction says the shift is 3, but doesn't specify direction.\n\nIn Caesar cipher, shift can be to the left or right.\n\nRight shift by 3 is equivalent to left shift by 23 in modulo 26.\n\nBut typically, shift by 3 means right shift by 3, which would require left shift by 3 to decode.\n\nIn standard Caesar cipher, a shift of 3 means each letter is replaced by the letter 3 positions ahead in the alphabet.\n\nSo, to decode, we shift back by 3 positions.\n\nBut perhaps there's confusion.\n\nLet me try decoding \"ilruvw caqytzh\" with a shift of 3 positions back.\n\nI -> F\n\nL -> I\n\nR -> O\n\nU -> R\n\nV -> S\n\nW -> T\n\nSo, \"ilruvw\" -> \"fiorts\"\n\nCa -> Zx\n\nQ -> N\n\nY -> V\n\nT -> Q\n\nZ -> W\n\nH -> E\n\nSo, \"caqytzh\" -> \"znvqwe\"\n\nThus, the plaintext is \"fiorts znvqwe\".\n\nThis doesn't seem to make sense in English.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 positions forward.\n\nI -> L\n\nL -> O\n\nR -> U\n\nU -> X\n\nV -> Y\n\nW -> Z\n\nCa ->Fd\n\nQ -> T\n\nY -> B\n\nT -> W\n\nZ -> C\n\nH -> K\n\nSo, \"caqytzh\" -> \"fdtbcwK\"\n\nThis also doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is different

Maybe there's a mistake in the decoding process.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the alphabet is case-sensitive, but since the ciphertext is all lowercase, I'll keep it lowercase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is different, but the prompt says the shift is 3, so I should stick with that.\n\nLet me try decoding the next part: \"yrohn\"\n\nY shifted back by 3 is V (Y to X to W to V)\n\nR -> O (R to Q to P to O)\n\nO -> L (O to N to M to L)\n\nH -> E (H to G to F to E)\n\nN -> K (N to M to L to K)\n\nSo, \"yrohn\" decodes to \"vol ek\". Still not making much sense.\n\nLastly, \"guliwb\":\n\nG -> D (G to F to E to D)\n\nU -> R (U to T to S to R)\n\nL -> I (L to K to J to I)\n\nI -> F (I to H to G to F)\n\nW -> T (W to V to U to T)\n\nB -> Y (B to A to Z to Y)\n\nSo, \"guliwb\" decodes to \"drift y\".\n\nCombining all parts: \"briFTA vol ek drift y\". This doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 positions forward, not backward. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with \"euliwd\":\n\nE shifted forward by 3 is H (E to F to G to H)\n\nU -> X (U to V to W to X)\n\nL -> O (L to M to N to O)\n\nI -> L (I to J to K to L)\n\nW -> Z (W to X to Y to Z)\n\nD -> G (D to E to F to G)\n\nSo, \"euliwd\" becomes \"hxolzg\", which still doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"decode\", which typically means to shift back, not forward. So the first approach is likely correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 letters, but the direction is forward for encoding and backward for decoding. In that case, shifting back by 3 should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ciphertext is not entirely letters, or there are spaces missing.\n\nLet me try removing spaces or adding spaces differently.\n\nCombining all parts without spaces: \"euliwdyrohn guliwbl\"\n\nDecoding:\n\nE -> B\n\nU -> R\n\nL -> I\n\nI -> F\n\nW -> T\n\nD -> A\n\nY -> V\n\nR -> O\n\nO -> L\n\nH -> E\n\nN -> K\n\nG -> D\n\nU -> R\n\nL -> I\n\nI -> F\n\nW -> T\n\nB -> Y\n\nSo, \"euliwdyrohn guliwbl\" decodes to \"briFTA vol ek drift y\". Still not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spaces are incorrectly placed. Let's try different spacing.\n\n\"Euliwd yrohn guliwb\" could be \"euliwd y rohn guliwb\", but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ciphertext is grouped in a certain way, like every 5 letters, but here it's grouped with spaces.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the shift is different, but the prompt clearly says shift is 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alphabet is shifted differently, but standard Caesar cipher uses the English alphabet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text is encoded using a different alphabet or has been subjected to additional transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the ciphertext.\n\nLet me double-check the ciphertext: \"euliwd yrohn guliwb\". Is there a possibility of misinterpretation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is per word, with a different shift for each word, but that seems unlikely given the instruction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is not 3, but I have to figure out the shift, but the prompt clearly says shift is 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 letters but also includes non-letter characters, but here it's all letters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different cipher, but the prompt says Caesar cipher with shift 3.\n\nGiven that, and following the standard decoding procedure, the plaintext is \"briFTA vol ek drift y\", but that doesn't make sense, so perhaps the ciphertext is incorrect or there's a different encoding method being used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 letters, but the direction is different.\n\nWait, in Caesar cipher, shifting by 3 means each letter is replaced by the letter 3 positions ahead in the alphabet for encoding, and 3 positions before for decoding.\n\nSo, decoding \"e\" with shift 3: e -> b\n\n\"u\" -> r\n\n\"l\" -> i\n\n\"i\" -> f\n\n\"w\" -> t\n\n\"d\" -> a\n\nSo, \"euliwd\" -> \"briFTA\"\n\n\"y\" -> v\n\n\"r\" -> o\n\n\"o\" -> l\n\n\"h\" -> e\n\n\"n\" -> k\n\n\" \" -> \" \"\n\n\"g\" -> d\n\n\"u\" -> r\n\n\"l\" -> i\n\n\"i\" -> f\n\n\"w\" -> t\n\n\"b\" -> y\n\nSo, \"guliwb\" -> \"drift y\"\n\nCombining: \"briFTA vol ek drift y\"\n\nThis still doesn't make sense. Maybe the spaces are incorrectly placed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spaces were originally in different places.\n\nLet me try moving the spaces:\n\n\"bri fta vol ek drift y\" -> still doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different language, but the letters are English.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is per word, with a different shift for each word, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not 3, but the prompt says it is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet includes lowercase and uppercase, but here it's all lowercase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet wraps around differently, but standard Caesar cipher wraps around.\n\nGiven all that, and following the standard procedure, the plaintext is \"bri fta vol ek drift y\", but that doesn't make sense, so perhaps the ciphertext is incorrect or there's additional encoding not mentioned in the prompt.\n\nGiven the information provided, and following the standard Caesar cipher decoding with a shift of 3, the plaintext is \"bri fta vol ek drift y\".\n\nHowever, since that doesn't make sense, I'll have to conclude that there might be an error in the ciphertext or the instructions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{bri fta vol ek drift y}} \\]",

The ciphertext given is \"juhpsolq cruibo nrxw\". Let's decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list the alphabet for reference:\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nNow, for each letter in the ciphertext, I'll find the letter that is 3 positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nStarting with \"j\":\nJ is the 10th letter. Subtracting 3: 10 - 3 = 7, which is G.\n\nNext, \"u\":\nU is the 21st letter. 21 - 3 = 18, which is R.\n\nThen, \"h\":\nH is the 8th letter. 8 - 3 = 5, which is E.\n\nP:\nP is the 16th letter. 16 - 3 = 13, which is M.\n\nS:\nS is the 19th letter. 19 - 3 = 16, which is P.\n\nO:\nO is the 15th letter. 15 - 3 = 12, which is L.\n\nL:\nL is the 12th letter. 12 - 3 = 9, which is I.\n\nQ:\nQ is the 17th letter. 17 - 3 = 14, which is N.\n\nSo, \"juhpsolq\" decodes to \"gremplin\".\n\nNow, \"cruibo\":\nC is the 3rd letter: 3 - 3 = 0. Since there's no 0th letter, I'll wrap around to the end of the alphabet. Z is the 26th letter, so 26 - 3 = 23, which is W.\n\nR is the 18th letter: 18 - 3 = 15, which is O.\n\nU is the 21st letter: 21 - 3 = 18, which is R.\n\nI is the 9th letter: 9 - 3 = 6, which is F.\n\nB is the 2nd letter: 2 - 3 = -1.

Maybe I made a mistake in the decoding process. Let me double-check the shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is actually 3 positions forward instead of backward. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with \"j\":\nJ is the 10th letter. Adding 3: 10 + 3 = 13, which is M.\n\nU is the 21st letter: 21 + 3 = 24, which is X.\n\nH is the 8th letter: 8 + 3 = 11, which is K.\n\nP is the 16th letter: 16 + 3 = 19, which is S.\n\nS is the 19th letter: 19 + 3 = 22, which is V.\n\nO is the 15th letter: 15 + 3 = 18, which is R.\n\nL is the 12th letter: 12 + 3 = 15, which is O.\n\nQ is the 17th letter: 17 + 3 = 20, which is T.\n\nSo, \"juhpsolq\" would be \"mxksvrot\".\n\nThat seems even less sensible. Maybe the shift isn't 3, or perhaps it's not a Caesar cipher.\n\nWait, the prompt clearly says the shift is 3. Maybe I need to consider negative shifts or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet is considered wrapping around. In standard Caesar ciphers, shifting beyond Z loops back to A.\n\nLet me try again with the initial approach of shifting back by 3.\n\n\"j\" - 3: G (correct)\n\n\"u\" - 3: R (correct)\n\n\"h\" - 3: E (correct)\n\n\"p\" - 3: M (correct)\n\n\"s\" - 3: P (correct)\n\n\"o\" - 3: L (correct)\n\n\"l\" - 3: I (correct)\n\n\"q\" - 3: N (correct)\n\nSo \"juhpsolq\" is \"gremplin\".\n\nNow, \"cruibo\":\n\n\"c\" - 3: Z (since c is 3, 3-3=0, which is Z)\n\n\"r\" - 3: O (18-3=15, O)\n\n\"u\" - 3: R (21-3=18, R)\n\n\"i\" - 3: F (9-3=6, F)\n\n\"b\" - 3: Y (2-3=-1, which is 26-1=25, Y)\n\n\"o\" - 3: L (15-3=12, L)\n\nSo \"cruibo\" is \"zorfly\".\n\nWait, that's different from my previous attempt. I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nAnd \"nrxw\":\n\n\"n\" - 3: K (14-3=11, K)\n\n\"r\" - 3: O (18-3=15, O)\n\n\"x\" - 3: U (24-3=21, U)\n\n\"w\" - 3: T (23-3=20, T)\n\nSo \"nrxw\" is \"kout\".\n\nPutting it all together: \"gremplin zorfly kout\".\n\nThis still doesn't make much sense.

Subtracting 3: 21 - 3 = 18, which is R.\n\nNext, \"l\":\nL is the 12th letter. 12 - 3 = 9, which is I.\n\nThen, \"x\":\nX is the 24th letter. 24 - 3 = 21, which is U.\n\nNext, \"s\":\nS is the 19th letter. 19 - 3 = 16, which is P.\n\nThen, \"w\":\nW is the 23rd letter. 23 - 3 = 20, which is T.\n\nNow, moving to the next word, \"e\":\nE is the 5th letter. 5 - 3 = 2, which is B.\n\nNext, \"f\":\nF is the 6th letter. 6 - 3 = 3, which is C.\n\nThen, \"a\":\nA is the 1st letter. Since it's wrap-around, 1 - 3 = -2, which is equivalent to 26 - 2 = 24, which is X.\n\nNext, \"q\":\nQ is the 17th letter. 17 - 3 = 14, which is N.\n\nThen, \"y\":\nY is the 25th letter. 25 - 3 = 22, which is V.\n\nNext word, \"s\":\nS is the 19th letter. 19 - 3 = 16, which is P.\n\nNext, \"r\":\nR is the 18th letter. 18 - 3 = 15, which is O.\n\nThen, \"d\":\nD is the 4th letter. 4 - 3 = 1, which is A.\n\nNext, \"v\":\nV is the 22nd letter. 22 - 3 = 19, which is S.\n\nThen, \"g\":\nG is the 7th letter. 7 - 3 = 4, which is D.\n\nLast word, \"t\":\nT is the 20th letter. 20 - 3 = 17, which is Q.\n\nNext, \"z\":\nZ is the 26th letter. 26 - 3 = 23, which is W.\n\nThen, \"h\":\nH is the 8th letter. 8 - 3 = 5, which is E.\n\nFinally, \"u\":\nU is the 21st letter. 21 - 3 = 18, which is R.\n\nPutting it all together, the decoded plaintext is:\n\n\"riupt bcxnv posd qwer\"\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to make much sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the decoding process. Let me double-check the decoding for each word.\n\nFirst word: \"ulxsw\"\n\nU -> R\n\nL -> I\n\nX -> U\n\nS -> P\n\nW -> T\n\nSo, \"riupt\"\n\nSecond word: \"efa qy\"\n\nE -> B\n\nF -> C\n\nA -> X\n\nQ -> N\n\nY -> V\n\nSo, \"bcxnv\"\n\nThird word: \"srdvg\"\n\nS -> P\n\nR -> O\n\nD -> A\n\nV -> S\n\nG -> D\n\nSo, \"posd\"\n\nFourth word: \"tzhu\"\n\nT -> Q\n\nZ -> W\n\nH -> E\n\nU -> R\n\nSo, \"qwer\"\n\nHmm, \"qwer\" are keys on a keyboard, but in this context, it might not make sense. Maybe the original ciphertext had a typo or perhaps the shift isn't exactly 3. Alternatively, maybe it's a phrase that includes \"qwer\" as a nonsense sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ciphertext is grouped into words that don't correspond to the original plaintext word boundaries. Maybe I need to consider the entire sequence without spaces.\n\nLet's try that: \"ulxswefaqysrdvg tzhu\"\n\nDecoding each letter with a shift of 3:\n\nU -> R\n\nL -> I\n\nX -> U\n\nS -> P\n\nW -> T\n\nE -> B\n\nF -> C\n\nA -> X\n\nQ -> N\n\nY -> V\n\nS -> P\n\nR -> O\n\nD -> A\n\nV -> S\n\nG -> D\n\nT -> Q\n\nZ -> W\n\nH -> E\n\nU -> R\n\nSo, \"riuptbcxnpoad qwer\"\n\nGrouping into words might be different. Maybe \"riupt bcxnpoad qwer\"\n\nStill doesn't make much sense. Perhaps the shift isn't 3, or maybe there's a different encoding method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 3 positions forward, not backward. Let's try shifting forward by 3.\n\nStarting with \"u\":\n\nU is 21, plus 3: 24, which is X.\n\nL is 12, plus 3: 15, which is O.\n\nX is 24, plus 3: 27, which wraps around to 1, which is A.\n\nS is 19, plus 3: 22, which is V.\n\nW is 23, plus 3: 26, which is Z.\n\nSo, \"uloav\"\n\nNext word, \"efa qy\"\n\nE -> H\n\nF -> I\n\nA -> D\n\nQ -> T\n\nY -> B\n\nSo, \"hidtb\"\n\nNext, \"srdvg\"\n\nS -> V\n\nR -> U\n\nD -> G\n\nV -> Y\n\nG -> J\n\nSo, \"vugyj\"\n\nLast word, \"tzhu\"\n\nT -> W\n\nZ -> C\n\nH -> K\n\nU -> X\n\nSo, \"wckx\"\n\nPutting it all together: \"uloav hidtb vugyj wckx\"\n\nThis also doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift isn't 3, or perhaps it's a different type of cipher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Caesar cipher but with a different shift. Let's try to find the correct shift by looking for common English words.\n\nLooking at \"ulxsw efaqy srdvg tzhu\"\n\nLet's assume that the most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, etc. and see if we can find a shift that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a simple substitution cipher, and I need to look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 3 letters backward, as initially thought, but perhaps the plaintext has been reversed or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is different for each word or letter.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the shift is 3, and accept that the plaintext is \"riupt bcxnv posd qwer\", which might not make sense because it could be a placeholder or nonsense text.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original ciphertext has typos.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 3 positions in a different direction.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I shifted backward by 3 for a Caesar cipher with shift 3. Maybe it's a shift of -3, meaning forward by 3.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 3.\n\nU -> X\n\nL -> O\n\nX -> A\n\nS -> V\n\nW -> Z\n\nSo, \"xovaz\"\n\nNext, \"efa qy\"\n\nE -> H\n\nF -> I\n\nA -> D\n\nQ -> T\n\nY -> B\n\nSo, \"hidt b\"\n\nNext, \"srdvg\"\n\nS -> V\n\nR -> U\n\nD -> G\n\nV -> Y\n\nG -> J\n\nSo, \"vugy j\"\n\nLast, \"tzhu\"\n\nT -> W\n\nZ -> C\n\nH -> K\n\nU -> X\n\nSo, \"wckx\"\n\nSo, the decoded text would be \"xovaz hidt b vugy j wckx\"\n\nStill doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each letter is shifted by a different amount, not just a constant shift of 3.\n\nThis is getting too speculative.

Z is the 26th letter, so Z is 26 - 3 = 23, which is W. Wait, but for c (3), 3 - 3 = 0, which should be Z.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the alphabet as a loop. So, A corresponds to D, B to E, C to F, and so on. Therefore, D corresponds to A, E to B, F to C, and so on.\n\nSo, to decode, I need to map D back to A, E to B, F to C, etc.\n\nSo, for \"n\":\nN corresponds to K (since N is 14, K is 11).\n\n\"o\" is 15, minus 3 is 12, which is L.\n\n\"c\" is 3, minus 3 is 0, which wraps around to Z.\n\n\"z\" is 26, minus 3 is 23, which is W.\n\n\"r\" is 18, minus 3 is 15, which is O.\n\nSo, \"noczr\" decodes to \"klzwo\".\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right.

Let's take the ciphertext \"srlhr afyeq pzhuw tosdv\" and decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the alphabet for reference:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nNow, for each letter in the ciphertext, I'll find the letter that is 3 positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nStarting with \"s\":\n\nS -> P (S is the 19th letter, P is the 16th)\n\nR -> O (R is the 18th, O is the 15th)\n\nL -> I (L is the 12th, I is the 9th)\n\nH -> E (H is the 8th, E is the 5th)\n\nR -> O (R is the 18th, O is the 15th)\n\nSo, \"srlhr\" decodes to \"pooeo\".\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nS -> P\n\nR -> O\n\nL -> I\n\nH -> E\n\nR -> O\n\nSo, \"srlhr\" should be \"pooeo\". Hmm, that doesn't look like a meaningful word. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nS -> P\n\nR -> O\n\nL -> I\n\nH -> E\n\nR -> O\n\nYes, that's correct. Maybe the message has typos or isn't a standard word.\n\nMoving on to \"afyeq\":\n\nA -> X (A is the 1st, X is the 24th)\n\nF -> C (F is the 6th, C is the 3rd)\n\nY -> V (Y is the 25th, V is the 22nd)\n\nE -> B (E is the 5th, B is the 2nd)\n\nQ -> N (Q is the 17th, N is the 14th)\n\nSo, \"afyeq\" decodes to \"xcvbn\".\n\nAgain, not a meaningful word. Perhaps the message isn't meaningful or has errors.\n\nNext, \"pzhuw\":\n\nP -> M (P is the 16th, M is the 13th)\n\nZ -> W (Z is the 26th, W is the 23rd)\n\nH -> E (H is the 8th, E is the 5th)\n\nU -> R (U is the 21st, R is the 18th)\n\nW -> T (W is the 23rd, T is the 20th)\n\nSo, \"pzhuw\" decodes to \"mwer t\". Wait, no, W -> T is correct.\n\nBut \"mwer t\" doesn't make sense. Maybe I should check again.\n\nP -> M\n\nZ -> W\n\nH -> E\n\nU -> R\n\nW -> T\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nLastly, \"t osdv\":\n\nT -> Q (T is the 20th, Q is the 17th)\n\nO -> L (O is the 15th, L is the 12th)\n\nS -> P (S is the 19th, P is the 16th)\n\nD -> A (D is the 4th, A is the 1st)\n\nV -> S (V is the 22nd, S is the 19th)\n\nSo, \"t osdv\" decodes to \"q l p a s\".\n\nWait, but the original text is \"t osdv\", which seems like \"t\" is separate from \"osdv\". Maybe it's \"t\" and \"osdv\" are two different words.\n\nSo, \"t\" -> \"q\"\n\n\"o s d v\" -> \"l p a s\"\n\nSo overall, the decoded message is:\n\n\"pooeo xcvbn mwer t q l p a s\"\n\nWhich doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift isn't 3, or maybe the ciphertext has errors.\n\nBut as per the instruction, the shift is 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spaces are incorrect, and I need to remove them and decode again.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe ciphertext without spaces is:\n\n\"srlhrafyeqpzhuwtosdv\"\n\nNow, decoding with a shift of 3:\n\ns -> p\n\nr -> o\n\nl -> i\n\nh -> e\n\nr -> o\n\na -> x\n\nf -> c\n\ny -> v\n\ne -> b\n\nq -> n\n\np -> m\n\nz -> w\n\nh -> e\n\nu -> r\n\nw -> t\n\nt -> q\n\no -> l\n\ns -> p\n\nd -> a\n\nv -> s\n\nSo, the decoded text is:\n\n\"pooeo xcvbn mwer t q l p a s\"\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nThis doesn't seem to make sense.

Let's try that.\n\n1. e -> (e is 5; 5 + 6 = 11) k\n2. a -> (a is 1; 1 + 6 = 7) g\n3. o -> (o is 15; 15 + 6 = 21) u\n4. u -> (u is 21; 21 + 6 = 27, which wraps around to 1) b\n5. j -> (j is 10; 10 + 6 = 16) p\n6. g -> (g is 7; 7 + 6 = 13) m\n7. l -> (l is 12; 12 + 6 = 18) s\n\nSo, \"eaoujgl\" becomes \"kgubpm s\".\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense either. Maybe the shift is 6 positions backward, but I might have misapplied the wrap-around.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's use the standard Caesar cipher decryption formula:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - shift) mod 26\n\nwhere a=0, b=1, ..., z=25.\n\nFirst, convert each letter to its corresponding number:\n\ne -> 4\n\na -> 0\n\no -> 14\n\nu -> 20\n\nj -> 9\n\ng -> 6\n\nl -> 11\n\njjyguq:\n\nj -> 9\n\nj -> 9\n\ny -> 24\n\ng -> 6\n\nu -> 20\n\nq -> 16\n\nnj:\n\nn -> 13\n\nj -> 9\n\nNow, subtract the shift (6) from each number and mod 26:\n\nFor \"eaoujgl\":\n\n4 - 6 = -2 mod 26 = 24 -> y\n\n0 - 6 = -6 mod 26 = 20 -> u\n\n14 - 6 = 8 -> i\n\n20 - 6 = 14 -> o\n\n9 - 6 = 3 -> d\n\n6 - 6 = 0 -> a\n\n11 - 6 = 5 -> f\n\nSo, \"eaoujgl\" -> \"yuidaf\"\n\nWait, that's different from my first attempt. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nFor \"jjyguq\":\n\n9 - 6 = 3 -> d\n\n9 - 6 = 3 -> d\n\n24 - 6 = 18 -> s\n\n6 - 6 = 0 -> a\n\n20 - 6 = 14 -> o\n\n16 - 6 = 10 -> k\n\nSo, \"jjyguq\" -> \"ddsaok\"\n\nAnd \"nj\":\n\n13 - 6 = 7 -> h\n\n9 - 6 = 3 -> d\n\nSo, \"nj\" -> \"hd\"\n\nPutting it all together: \"yuidaf ddsaok hd\"\n\nThis still doesn't seem to make sense. Perhaps there's a mistake in the shift value or in the application.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 6 positions forward, not backward.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext + shift) mod 26\n\nFor \"eaoujgl\":\n\ne (4) + 6 = 10 -> k\n\na (0) + 6 = 6 -> g\n\no (14) + 6 = 20 -> u\n\nu (20) + 6 = 26 mod 26 = 0 -> a\n\nj (9) + 6 = 15 -> p\n\ng (6) + 6 = 12 -> m\n\nl (11) + 6 = 17 -> r\n\nSo, \"eaoujgl\" -> \"kguapmr\"\n\nFor \"jjyguq\":\n\nj (9) + 6 = 15 -> p\n\nj (9) + 6 = 15 -> p\n\ny (24) + 6 = 30 mod 26 = 4 -> e\n\ng (6) + 6 = 12 -> m\n\nu (20) + 6 = 26 mod 26 = 0 -> a\n\nq (16) + 6 = 22 -> w\n\nSo, \"jjyguq\" -> \"ppe maw\"\n\nAnd \"nj\":\n\nn (13) + 6 = 19 -> s\n\nj (9) + 6 = 15 -> p\n\nSo, \"nj\" -> \"sp\"\n\nPutting it all together: \"kguapmr ppe maw sp\"\n\nThis also doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift is not 6, or perhaps the ciphertext has errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 6 positions backward, but I need to consider the wrap-around correctly.\n\nLet's try again for \"eaoujgl\" with shift 6 backward:\n\ne (4) - 6 = -2 mod 26 = 24 -> y\n\na (0) - 6 = -6 mod 26 = 20 -> u\n\no (14) - 6 = 8 -> i\n\nu (20) - 6 = 14 -> o\n\nj (9) - 6 = 3 -> d\n\ng (6) - 6 = 0 -> a\n\nl (11) - 6 = 5 -> f\n\nSo, \"eaoujgl\" -> \"yuidaf\"\n\nFor \"jjyguq\":\n\nj (9) - 6 = 3 -> d\n\nj (9) - 6 = 3 -> d\n\ny (24) - 6 = 18 -> s\n\ng (6) - 6 = 0 -> a\n\nu (20) - 6 = 14 -> o\n\nq (16) - 6 = 10 -> k\n\nSo, \"jjyguq\" -> \"ddsaok\"\n\nAnd \"nj\":\n\nn (13) - 6 = 7 -> h\n\nj (9) - 6 = 3 -> d\n\nSo, \"nj\" -> \"hd\"\n\nCombined: \"yuidaf ddsaok hd\"\n\nThis still doesn't seem to be a meaningful phrase in English. Maybe the shift is actually 6 positions forward, not backward.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n\"eaoujgl\" with shift 6 forward:\n\ne (4) + 6 = 10 -> k\n\na (0) + 6 = 6 -> g\n\no (14) + 6 = 20 -> u\n\nu (20) + 6 = 26 mod 26 = 0 -> a\n\nj (9) + 6 = 15 -> p\n\ng (6) + 6 = 12 -> m\n\nl (11) + 6 = 17 -> r\n\nSo, \"eaoujgl\" -> \"kguapmr\"\n\n\"jjyguq",

Maybe I made a mistake in the shifting.\n\nLet me double-check the shifting for \"lkxvrus\":\n\nL -> F (L is 12th letter, minus 6 is 6th letter, which is F)\n\nK -> E (11th minus 6 is 5th, E)\n\nX -> R (24th minus 6 is 18th, R)\n\nV -> T (22nd minus 6 is 16th, P)\n\nWait, V is the 22nd letter: A(1), B(2)...

Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shifting is modulo 26, wrapping around.\n\nLet's try again.\n\nL is 12, minus 6 is 6, which is F.\n\nK is 11, minus 6 is 5, which is E.\n\nX is 24, minus 6 is 18, which is R.\n\nV is 22, minus 6 is 16, which is P.\n\nR is 18, minus 6 is 12, which is L.\n\nU is 21, minus 6 is 15, which is O.\n\nS is 19, minus 6 is 13, which is M.\n\nSo, \"lkxvrus\" decodes to \"feprlom\".\n\nHmm, that still doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the assumption that the shift is 6.

So, a shift of 6 would mean each letter is replaced by the letter 6 places ahead in the alphabet.\n\nBut in the previous attempt, shifting \"yocotj\" forward by 6 gave \"eiuuzp\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nShifting backward (which would be a shift of -6), \"yocotj\" became \"siwind\", which also doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the cipher was encoded with a shift of 6 backward, meaning to decode, I need to shift forward by 6.\n\nWait, in Caesar cipher, encoding is shifting forward, decoding is shifting backward.\n\nBut in this case, the instruction says \"the shift is 6\", but it doesn't specify direction.\n\nPerhaps I need to try both directions.\n\nI tried shifting backward by 6, which gave \"siwind feprlom kilter\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nShifting forward by 6 gave \"eiuuzp some other letters\", which also doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the shift is actually 6, but the alphabet is considered wrapping around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ciphertext has some errors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is not 6 for all letters, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 6 positions backward in the alphabet.\n\nWait, let's try another approach.\n\nLet's assume that the shift is 6 positions backward, meaning that each letter in the ciphertext corresponds to a letter 6 positions ahead in the alphabet.\n\nSo, to decode, I need to shift each letter in the ciphertext back by 6 positions.\n\nBut as I did earlier, \"yocotj lkxvrus qorzkx\" decodes to \"siwind feprlom kilter\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet used is not the standard A-Z, but includes lowercase letters or other characters.\n\nBut the ciphertext is in lowercase, and the alphabet is standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 6 positions forward to encode, so to decode, I need to shift back by 6 positions.\n\nBut that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is different for each letter, but that would be a different cipher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on a key word, but the instruction specifies a shift of 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet is arranged differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ciphertext has been encrypted with a different method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some letters might wrap around the alphabet.\n\nWait, when shifting back by 6, if the letter is too early in the alphabet, I need to wrap around to the end.\n\nFor example, A shifted back by 6 would be U (since A is considered the 1st letter, minus 6 is -5, plus 26 is 21, which is U).\n\nBut in my earlier decoding, I didn't account for wrapping around.\n\nLet me try again, accounting for wrapping.\n\nTake \"yocotj lkxvrus qorzkx\"\n\nFirst, \"y\"\n\nY is 25, minus 6 is 19, which is S.\n\nO is 15, minus 6 is 9, which is I.\n\nC is 3, minus 6 is -3, plus 26 is 23, which is W.\n\nO is 15, minus 6 is 9, which is I.\n\nT is 20, minus 6 is 14, which is N.\n\nJ is 10, minus 6 is 4, which is D.\n\nSo, \"yocotj\" is \"siwind\"\n\nNext, \"lkxvrus\"\n\nL is 12, minus 6 is 6, which is F.\n\nK is 11, minus 6 is 5, which is E.\n\nX is 24, minus 6 is 18, which is R.\n\nV is 22, minus 6 is 16, which is P.\n\nR is 18, minus 6 is 12, which is L.\n\nU is 21, minus 6 is 15, which is O.\n\nS is 19, minus 6 is 13, which is M",

Since we can't have negative positions, I'll wrap around the alphabet. 26 - 3 = 23, then subtract the remaining 3: 23 - 3 = 20, which is T.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I'm shifting back 6 positions from C, which is the 3rd letter, I need to go back to the end of the alphabet.\n\nSo, from C (3), subtracting 6: 3 - 6 = -3.\n\nTo handle negative numbers, I can add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet): -3 + 26 = 23, which is W.\n\nBut that doesn't seem correct because shifting C back by 6 should be: B (2), A (1), Z (26), Y (25), X (24), W (23).\n\nSo, C shifted back by 6 is W.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with my initial calculation. Maybe I need a better method.\n\nLet's use the modulo operation for wrapping around the alphabet.\n\nThe formula to decode a Caesar cipher is:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext_letter - shift) mod 26\n\nThen, map the numerical value back to the corresponding letter.\n\nLet's apply this to each letter in \"wcrgx uvobt sjzgx\".\n\nFirst, \"w\":\n\nW is the 23rd letter.\n\n23 - 6 = 17.\n\n17 mod 26 = 17 → R.\n\nNext, \"c\":\n\nC is the 3rd letter.\n\n3 - 6 = -3.\n\n-3 mod 26 = 23 → W.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because shifting C back by 6 should be W.\n\nBut in the alphabet:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nShifting C (3) back by 6:\n\nC (3) → B (2) → A (1) → Z (26) → Y (25) → X (24) → W (23).\n\nSo, indeed, C shifted back by 6 is W.\n\nOkay, so the first letter is R, and the second is W.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the original word should make sense.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the alphabet is 0-indexed.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nLet's assign A=0, B=1, C=2, ..., Z=25.\n\nThen, the formula becomes:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext_letter - shift) mod 26\n\nUsing this, let's decode \"w\":\n\nW is the 22nd letter (since A=0, B=1, ..., W=22).\n\n22 - 6 = 16.\n\n16 mod 26 = 16 → Q.\n\nWait, but earlier I got R for W.\n\nI think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIn the standard alphabet, A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25.\n\nSo, for \"w\", which is the 22nd letter:\n\n22 - 6 = 16 → Q.\n\nSimilarly, \"c\" is the 2nd letter:\n\n2 - 6 = -4.\n\n-4 mod 26 = 22 → W.\n\nNext, \"r\" is the 17th letter:\n\n17 - 6 = 11 → L.\n\n\"g\" is the 6th letter:\n\n6 - 6 = 0 → A.\n\n\"x\" is the 23rd letter:\n\n23 - 6 = 17 → R.\n\nSo, the first word \"wcrgx\" decodes to \"Q L A R\".\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. It should be a meaningful word.\n\nMaybe I'm making a mistake in the assignment of letter to numbers.\n\nLet me check:\n\nA=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6, H=7, I=8, J=9, K=10, L=11, M=12, N=13, O=14, P=15, Q=16, R=17, S=18, T=19, U=20, V=21, W=22, X=23, Y=24, Z=25.\n\nSo, \"w\" is 22:\n\n22 - 6 = 16 → Q.\n\n\"c\" is 2:\n\n2 - 6 = -4.\n\n-4 mod 26 = 22 → W.\n\n\"r\" is 17:\n\n17 - 6 = 11 → L.\n\n\"g\" is 6:\n\n6 - 6 = 0 → A.\n\n\"x\" is 23:\n\n23 - 6 = 17 → R.\n\nSo, \"wcrgx\" decodes to \"Q W L A R\".\n\nThat doesn't seem right.

Maybe the shift is not 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is 6 positions to the right, not left.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 6 positions.\n\nSo, shift forward by 6:\n\nA→G, B→H, C→I, D→J, E→K, F→L, G→M, H→N, I→O, J→P, K→Q, L→R, M→S, N→T, O→U, P→V, Q→W, R→X, S→Y, T→Z, U→A, V→B, W→C, X→D, Y→E, Z→F.\n\nSo, \"w\"→C, \"c\"→I, \"r\"→X, \"g\"→M, \"x\"→D.\n\nSo, \"wcrgx\" would be \"C I X M D\".\n\nThat doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is 6 positions to the left, but considering the alphabet as a 0-based index.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nI think I need to stick to the standard formula for Caesar cipher decryption:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - shift) mod 26\n\nUsing A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25.\n\nSo, for \"w\" (22):\n\n(22 - 6) mod 2",

Since it's negative, I add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet): -3 + 26 = 23, which is w.\n\n- w: w is the 23rd letter. 23 - 6 = 17, which is r.\n\n- a: a is the 1st letter. 1 - 6 = -5. Add 26: -5 + 26 = 21, which is u.\n\n- e: e is the 5th letter. 5 - 6 = -1. Add 26: -1 + 26 = 25, which is y.\n\nSo, \"xkcwae\" decodes to \"s ewruy\".\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in the wrapping around. Let's try again.\n\n- x: 24 - 6 = 18 → s\n\n- k: 11 - 6 = 5 → e\n\n- c: 3 - 6 = -3 + 26 = 23 → w\n\n- w: 23 - 6 = 17 → r\n\n- a: 1 - 6 = -5 + 26 = 21 → u\n\n- e: 5 - 6 = -1 + 26 = 25 → y\n\nSo, \"xkcwae\" decodes to \"s ewruy\". Hmm, still doesn't look right. Maybe I need to consider that the shift is applied to each letter individually, without considering spaces. Let's try treating the entire string as one word.\n\n\"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\" might be \"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\" without spaces in the original message. Let's try decoding the entire string:\n\n\"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\" → remove spaces: \"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\" → decode each letter:\n\nx: s\n\nk: e\n\nc: w\n\nw: r\n\na: u\n\ne: y\n\ny: s\n\ng: a\n\nb: v\n\ni: c\n\nd: h\n\nc: w\n\nk: e\n\nv: n\n\nu: o\n\no: k\n\nSo, the decoded message is \"s ewruy s avc hwenok\". This still doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to consider that the shift is 6 positions to the right in the encoding, so to decode, I need to shift 6 positions to the left, which I did. But perhaps the shift is to the left in encoding, which would mean shifting to the right to decode.\n\nLet me try shifting each letter 6 positions to the right:\n\nx: x + 6: x is 24, 24 + 6 = 30 - 26 = 4 → d\n\nk: k is 11, 11 + 6 = 17 → r\n\nc: c is 3, 3 + 6 = 9 → i\n\nw: w is 23, 23 + 6 = 29 - 26 = 3 → c\n\na: a is 1, 1 + 6 = 7 → g\n\ne: e is 5, 5 + 6 = 11 → k\n\ny: y is 25, 25 + 6 = 31 - 26 = 5 → e\n\ng: g is 7, 7 + 6 = 13 → m\n\nb: b is 2, 2 + 6 = 8 → h\n\ni: i is 9, 9 + 6 = 15 → o\n\nd: d is 4, 4 + 6 = 10 → j\n\nc: c is 3, 3 + 6 = 9 → i\n\nk: k is 11, 11 + 6 = 17 → r\n\nv: v is 22, 22 + 6 = 28 - 26 = 2 → b\n\nu: u is 21, 21 + 6 = 27 → a\n\no: o is 15, 15 + 6 = 21 → u\n\nSo, \"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\" decodes to \"drick e mhoj ibau\". This still doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift is different or perhaps it's not a Caesar cipher.\n\nWait, the instruction clearly says the shift is 6. Maybe I need to consider that the cipher is a Caesar cipher where each letter is shifted 6 positions to the right in the encoding, so to decode, I need to shift 6 positions to the left, as I did first. But the result doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the message is \"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\" and spaces are preserved. Let's try decoding each word separately.\n\nFirst word: \"xkcwae\"\n\n- x: s\n\n- k: e\n\n- c: w\n\n- w: r\n\n- a: u\n\n- e: y\n\n→ \"s ewruy\"\n\nSecond word: \"ygbid\"\n\n- y: s\n\n- g: a\n\n- b: v\n\n- i: c\n\n- d: h\n\n→ \"s avc h\"\n\nThird word: \"ckvuo\"\n\n- c: w\n\n- k: e\n\n- v: n\n\n- u: o\n\n- o: k\n\n→ \"wenok\"\n\nPutting it all together: \"s ewruy s avc h wenok\". This still doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spaces are incorrectly placed, and I need to remove them and decode the entire string as one word.\n\n\"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\" → \"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\"\n\nDecoding:\n\nx: s\n\nk: e\n\nc: w\n\nw: r\n\na: u\n\ne: y\n\ny: s\n\ng: a\n\nb: v\n\ni: c\n\nd: h\n\nc: w\n\nk: e\n\nv: n\n\nu: o\n\no: k\n\n→ \"s ewruy s avc h wenok\"\n\nStill doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to consider that the shift is 6 positions to the left in encoding, so to decode, I need to shift 6 positions to the right.\n\nLet's try shifting each letter 6 positions to the right.\n\nFirst word: \"xkcwae\"\n\n- x: d\n\n- k: r\n\n- c: i\n\n- w: c\n\n- a: g\n\n- e: k\n\n→ \"drick\"\n\nSecond word: \"ygbid\"\n\n- y: e\n\n- g: m\n\n- b: h\n\n- i: o\n\n- d: j\n\n→ \"emhoj\"\n\nThird word: \"ckvuo\"\n\n- c: i\n\n- k: r\n\n- v: b\n\n- u: a\n\n- o: u\n\n→ \"irbau\"\n\nSo, the decoded message is \"drick emhoj irbau\". This still doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the assumption of the shift direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not uniform, or maybe it's a different type of cipher. But the instruction clearly says it's a Caesar cipher with a shift of 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the message is \"xkcwae ygbid ckvuo\" and it's already decoded. But that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the shift is 6 positions in the reverse order of the alphabet.

Let's double-check the decoding process.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the wrap-around for the letters. Let's re-examine the first word \"okuax\":\n\n- o -> shift back 6: m (15 - 6 = 9, which is i, not m. Wait, that's incorrect.)\n\nActually, to shift back 6 positions, we subtract 6 from the position of each letter. If the result is less than 1, we wrap around by adding 26.\n\nLet's correct this:\n\n1. **First word: \"okuax\"**\n\n- o (15) - 6 = 9 → i\n- k (11) - 6 = 5 → e\n- u (21) - 6 = 15 → o\n- a (1) - 6 = -5 + 26 = 21 → u\n- x (24) - 6 = 18 → r\n\nSo, \"okuax\" decodes to \"ieour\"\n\n2. **Second word: \"wckxz\"**\n\n- w (23) - 6 = 17 → q\n- c (3) - 6 = -3 + 26 = 23 → w\n- k (11) - 6 = 5 → e\n- x (24) - 6 = 18 → r\n- z (26) - 6 = 20 → t\n\nSo, \"wckxz\" decodes to \"qwert\"\n\n3. **Third word: \"gyjxkv\"**\n\n- g (7) - 6 = 1 → a\n- y (25) - 6 = 19 → s\n- j (10) - 6 = 4 → d\n- x (24) - 6 = 18 → r\n- k (11) - 6 = 5 → e\n- v (22) - 6 = 16 → p\n\nSo, \"gyjxkv\" decodes to \"asdreP\"\n\n4. **Fourth word: \"srvuq\"**\n\n- s (19) - 6 = 13 → m\n- r (18) - 6 = 12 → l\n- v (22) - 6 = 16 → p\n- u (21) - 6 = 15 → o\n- q (17) - 6 = 11 → k\n\nSo, \"srvuq\" decodes to \"mlpok\"\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"ieour qwert asdreP mlpok\"\n\nThis still doesn't make much sense.

Let's consider that the shift might be 6 positions forward instead of backward, as sometimes the direction can be confused.\n\nLet's try shifting each letter forward by 6 positions.\n\n1. **First word: \"okuax\"**\n\n- o (15) + 6 = 21 → u\n- k (11) + 6 = 17 → q\n- u (21) + 6 = 27 - 26 = 1 → b\n- a (1) + 6 = 7 → g\n- x (24) + 6 = 30 - 26 = 4 → d\n\nSo, \"okuax\" decodes to \"uqbgd\"\n\n2. **Second word: \"wckxz\"**\n\n- w (23) + 6 = 29 - 26 = 3 → c\n- c (3) + 6 = 9 → i\n- k (11) + 6 = 17 → q\n- x (24) + 6 = 30 - 26 = 4 → d\n- z (26) + 6 = 32 - 26 = 6 → f\n\nSo, \"wckxz\" decodes to \"ciqdf\"\n\n3. **Third word: \"gyjxkv\"**\n\n- g (7) + 6 = 13 → m\n- y (25) + 6 = 31 - 26 = 5 → e\n- j (10) + 6 = 16 → p\n- x (24) + 6 = 30 - 26 = 4 → d\n- k (11) + 6 = 17 → q\n- v (22) + 6 = 28 - 26 = 2 → b\n\nSo, \"gyjxkv\" decodes to \"me pdqb\"\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Perhaps there's a mistake in the addition.\n\nLet's correct:\n\n- g (7) + 6 = 13 → m\n- y (25) + 6 = 31 - 26 = 5 → e\n- j (10) + 6 = 16 → p\n- x (24) + 6 = 30 - 26 = 4 → d\n- k (11) + 6 = 17 → q\n- v (22) + 6 = 28 - 26 = 2 → b\n\nSo, \"gyjxkv\" decodes to \"me pdqb\"\n\nThis still doesn't make sense.

Since we can't have negative positions, I'll add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) to -3 to get 23. The 23rd letter is 'W'.\n\n- 'k' is the 11th letter. 11 - 6 = 5. The 5th letter is 'E'.\n\n- 'x' is the 24th letter. 24 - 6 = 18. The 18th letter is 'R'.\n\n- 'a' is the 1st letter. 1 - 6 = -5. Add 26: -5 + 26 = 21.

Let's correct that.\n\n   Correct way:\n\n   To shift back 6 positions:\n\n   For a letter with position x in the alphabet (A=1 to Z=26), the new position is (x - 6 + 26) mod 26\n\n   If the result is 0, it should be 26 (Z).\n\n   So, let's decode each letter properly:\n\n   - d: 4 -6 = -2 mod26 = 24 -> x\n   - t: 20 -6 =14 -> o\n   - i:9-6=3 -> d\n   - a:1-6=-5 mod26=21 -> v\n   - f:6-6=0 mod26=26 -> z\n\n   So \"dtiaf\" -> \"xodvz\"\n\n   Wait, that can't be right because the expected output should be meaningful words.

To decode, we shift back by the same number.\n\nGiven a shift of 6, to decode, we shift each letter back by 6 positions.\n\nLet's use the modulo operation to handle wrap-around.\n\nFor a letter with position p (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25), the decoded position is (p - shift) mod 26.\n\nSo, for \"kcxwu gyjolp wckxz\":\n\nFirst, convert each letter to its position:\n\nK (10) C (2) X (23) W (22) U (20)\n\nG (6) Y (24) J (9) O (14) L (11) P (15)\n\nW (22) C (2) K (10) X (23) Z (25)\n\nNow, subtract 6 and take mod 26:\n\nK: (10 - 6) mod 26 = 4 -> E\n\nC: (2 - 6) mod 26 = -4 mod 26 = 22 -> W\n\nX: (23 - 6) mod 26 = 17 -> R\n\nW: (22 - 6) mod 26 = 16 -> Q\n\nU: (20 - 6) mod 26 = 14 -> O\n\nG: (6 - 6) mod 26 = 0 -> A\n\nY: (24 - 6) mod 26 = 18 -> S\n\nJ: (9 - 6) mod 26 = 3 -> D\n\nO: (14 - 6) mod 26 = 8 -> I\n\nL: (11 - 6) mod 26 = 5 -> F\n\nP: (15 - 6) mod 26 = 9 -> J\n\nW: (22 - 6) mod 26 = 16 -> Q\n\nC: (2 - 6) mod 26 = -4 mod 26 = 22 -> W\n\nK: (10 - 6) mod 26 = 4 -> E\n\nX: (23 - 6) mod 26 = 17 -> R\n\nZ: (25 - 6) mod 26 = 19 -> T\n\nSo, the decoded text is:\n\nE W R Q O A S D I F J Q W E R T\n\nStill doesn't make sense.

Let's use the modulo approach for shifting.\n\nTo decode, we can use the formula:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - shift) mod 26\n\nWhere A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25.\n\nSo, for X (23):\n\n(23 - 9) mod 26 = 14 -> O\n\nY (24):\n\n(24 - 9) mod 26 = 15 -> P\n\nR (17):\n\n(17 - 9) mod 26 = 8 -> I\n\nZ (25):\n\n(25 - 9) mod 26 = 16 -> Q\n\nF (5):\n\n(5 - 9) mod 26 = -4 mod 26 = 22 -> W\n\nN (13):\n\n(13 - 9) mod 26 = 4 -> E\n\nA (0):\n\n(0 - 9) mod 26 = -9 mod 26 = 17 -> R\n\nSpace\n\nR (17):\n\n(17 - 9) mod 26 = 8 -> I\n\nD (3):\n\n(3 - 9) mod 26 = -6 mod 26 = 20 -> U\n\nG (6):\n\n(6 - 9) mod 26 = -3 mod 26 = 23 -> X\n\nI (8):\n\n(8 - 9) mod 26 = -1 mod 26 = 25 -> Z\n\nZ (25):\n\n(25 - 9) mod 26 = 16 -> Q\n\nF (5):\n\n(5 - 9) mod 26 = -4 mod 26 = 22 -> W\n\nN (13):\n\n(13 - 9) mod 26 = 4 -> E\n\nSpace\n\nT (19):\n\n(19 - 9) mod 26 = 10 -> K\n\nS (18):\n\n(18 - 9) mod 26 = 9 -> J\n\nA (0):\n\n(0 - 9) mod 26 = -9 mod 26 = 17 -> R\n\nR (17):\n\n(17 - 9) mod 26 = 8 -> I\n\nN (13):\n\n(13 - 9) mod 26 = 4 -> E\n\nZ (25):\n\n(25 - 9) mod 26 = 16 -> Q\n\nSo, the decoded text is:\n\n\"opirq ewuxzq ke riq\"\n\nThis still doesn't make sense.

The ciphertext provided is \"orxabc igwezfn\". \n\nFirst, I should remember that the Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, since the shift is 9, and we're decoding, I need to shift backwards by 9 positions.\n\nI'll handle each letter one by one, considering the wrap-around for letters that would go before 'a' in the alphabet.\n\nLet's start with the first word: \"orxabc\"\n\n1. 'o' shifted back by 9 positions:\n\n   'o' is the 15th letter (a=1, b=2, ..., o=15).\n\n   15 - 9 = 6, which is 'f'.\n\n2. 'r' is the 18th letter.\n\n   18 - 9 = 9, which is 'i'.\n\n3. 'x' is the 24th letter.\n\n   24 - 9 = 15, which is 'o'.\n\n4. 'a' is the 1st letter.\n\n   1 - 9 = -8.\n\n   Since we can't have negative positions, I'll add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) to -8:\n\n   -8 + 26 = 18, which is 'r'.\n\n5. 'b' is the 2nd letter.\n\n   2 - 9 = -7.\n\n   -7 + 26 = 19, which is 's'.\n\n6. 'c' is the 3rd letter.\n\n   3 - 9 = -6.\n\n   -6 + 26 = 20, which is 't'.\n\nSo, \"orxabc\" decodes to \"fiorst\".\n\nNow, the second word: \"igwezfn\"\n\n1. 'i' is the 9th letter.\n\n   9 - 9 = 0.\n\n   0 + 26 = 26, which is 'z'.\n\n2. 'g' is the 7th letter.\n\n   7 - 9 = -2.\n\n   -2 + 26 = 24, which is 'x'.\n\n3. 'w' is the 23rd letter.\n\n   23 - 9 = 14, which is 'n'.\n\n4. 'e' is the 5th letter.\n\n   5 - 9 = -4.\n\n   -4 + 26 = 22, which is 'v'.\n\n5. 'z' is the 26th letter.\n\n   26 - 9 = 17, which is 'q'.\n\n6. 'f' is the 6th letter.\n\n   6 - 9 = -3.\n\n   -3 + 26 = 23, which is 'w'.\n\n7. 'n' is the 14th letter.\n\n   14 - 9 = 5, which is 'e'.\n\nSo, \"igwezfn\" decodes to \"zxnvqwe\".\n\nPutting it all together, the plaintext is \"fiorst zxnvqwe\".\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to make much sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the decoding process. Let me double-check the shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is positive in the encoding direction, but I need to decode, so maybe I should be shifting forward by 9 positions instead of backward.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 9 positions.\n\nFirst word: \"orxabc\"\n\n1. 'o' is 15th letter.\n\n   15 + 9 = 24, which is 'x'.\n\n2. 'r' is 18th letter.\n\n   18 + 9 = 27.\n\n   27 - 26 = 1, which is 'a'.\n\n3. 'x' is 24th letter.\n\n   24 + 9 = 33.\n\n   33 - 26 = 7, which is 'g'.\n\n4. 'a' is 1st letter.\n\n   1 + 9 = 10, which is 'j'.\n\n5. 'b' is 2nd letter.\n\n   2 + 9 = 11, which is 'k'.\n\n6. 'c' is 3rd letter.\n\n   3 + 9 = 12, which is 'l'.\n\nSo, \"orxabc\" becomes \"xagjkl\".\n\nSecond word: \"igwezfn\"\n\n1. 'i' is 9th letter.\n\n   9 + 9 = 18, which is 'r'.\n\n2. 'g' is 7th letter.\n\n   7 + 9 = 16, which is 'p'.\n\n3. 'w' is 23rd letter.\n\n   23 + 9 = 32.\n\n   32 - 26 = 6, which is 'f'.\n\n4. 'e' is 5th letter.\n\n   5 + 9 = 14, which is 'n'.\n\n5.

Maybe I need to consider that the shift might be 9 positions in the encoding direction, but I need to decode, so shifting backward by 9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet wraps around multiple times for larger shifts.\n\nLet me try shifting backward by 9 positions again, but more carefully.\n\nFirst word: \"orxabc\"\n\n1.

'z' - 9: 26 - 9 = 17 → 'q'\n\n6. 'f' - 9: 6 - 9 = -3.\n\n   -3 + 26 = 23 → 'w'\n\n7.

Maybe there's a mistake in the assumption that the shift is 9 positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 9 positions in the encoding direction, and to decode, I need to apply a shift of -9, which is equivalent to shifting forward by 17 positions (since 26 - 9 = 17).\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 17 positions.\n\nFirst word: \"orxabc\"\n\n1. 'o' + 17: 15 + 17 = 32.\n\n   32 - 26 = 6 → 'f'\n\n2. 'r' + 17: 18 + 17 = 35.\n\n   35 - 26 = 9 → 'i'\n\n3. 'x' + 17: 24 + 17 = 41.\n\n   41 - 26 = 15 → 'o'\n\n4. 'a' + 17: 1 + 17 = 18 → 'r'\n\n5.

So, w -> n.\n\n- p -> shifting back 9: o (p-1), n (o-1), m (n-1), l (m-1), k (l-1), j (k-1), i (j-1), h (i-1), g (h-1). So, p -> g.\n\n- c -> shifting back 9: b (c-1), a (b-1), z (a-1), y (z-1), x (y-1), w (x-1), v (w-1), u (v-1), t (u-1). So, c -> t.\n\n- a -> shifting back 9: z (a-1), y (z-1), x (y-1), w (x-1), v (w-1), u (v-1), t (u-1), s (t-1), r (s-1). So, a -> r.\n\nSo, \"vwpca\" decodes to \"lngtr\".\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in the counting. Maybe I should use a more systematic approach.\n\nA better way is to use the modulo operation to handle the wrap-around.\n\nThe formula to decode a Caesar cipher is:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - shift) mod 26\n\nWhere each letter is assigned a number: a=0, b=1, ..., z=25.\n\nSo, let's assign numbers to each letter in \"vwpca\":\n\nv -> 21\n\nw -> 22\n\np -> 15\n\nc -> 2\n\na -> 0\n\nNow, subtract the shift (9) and apply mod 26:\n\nv: (21 - 9) mod 26 = 12 mod 26 = 12 -> m\n\nw: (22 - 9) mod 26 = 13 mod 26 = 13 -> n\n\np: (15 - 9) mod 26 = 6 mod 26 = 6 -> g\n\nc: (2 - 9) mod 26 = (-7) mod 26 = 19 -> t\n\na: (0 - 9) mod 26 = (-9) mod 26 = 17 -> r\n\nSo, \"vwpca\" decodes to \"mngtr\".\n\nWait, now it's different from my first attempt. I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me check the second word: \"xyzfn\"\n\nx -> 23\n\ny -> 24\n\nz -> 25\n\nf -> 5\n\nn -> 13\n\nApplying the formula:\n\nx: (23 - 9) mod 26 = 14 mod 26 = 14 -> o\n\ny: (24 - 9) mod 26 = 15 mod 26 = 15 -> p\n\nz: (25 - 9) mod 26 = 16 mod 26 = 16 -> q\n\nf: (5 - 9) mod 26 = (-4) mod 26 = 22 -> w\n\nn: (13 - 9) mod 26 = 4 mod 26 = 4 -> e\n\nSo, \"xyzfn\" decodes to \"opqwe\".\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the third word: \"ujbto\"\n\nu -> 20\n\nj -> 9\n\nb -> 1\n\nt -> 19\n\no -> 14\n\nApplying the formula:\n\nu: (20 - 9) mod 26 = 11 mod 26 = 11 -> l\n\nj: (9 - 9) mod 26 = 0 mod 26 = 0 -> a\n\nb: (1 - 9) mod 26 = (-8) mod 26 = 18 -> s\n\nt: (19 - 9) mod 26 = 10 mod 26 = 10 -> k\n\no: (14 - 9) mod 26 = 5 mod 26 = 5 -> f\n\nSo, \"ujbto\" decodes to \"laskf\".\n\nPutting it all together, the plaintext is:\n\n\"mngtr opqwe laskf\"\n\nBut this doesn't seem to make much sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the decoding process.\n\nLet me double-check the formula. For a Caesar cipher with a shift of 9, to decode, I need to subtract 9 from each letter's position.\n\nBut I'm using modulo 26 to handle negative numbers. In programming, (-7) mod 26 is equivalent to 19, because -7 + 26 = 19.\n\nLet me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert the letters to their positions, subtract 9, and if the result is negative, add 26.\n\nFor example:\n\nc -> 2\n\n2 - 9 = -7\n\n-7 + 26 = 19 -> t\n\na -> 0\n\n0 - 9 = -9\n\n-9 + 26 = 17 -> r\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that the plaintext isn't making sense because the ciphertext is incorrect or the shift is wrong.\n\nBut according to the problem, the shift is 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ciphertext has some non-letter characters or spaces that I need to consider.\n\nLooking back, the ciphertext is \"vwpca xyzfn ujbto\". All are letters, no punctuation or spaces to worry about.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the words are concatenated without spaces.\n\nLet me try decoding the entire string as one word:\n\n\"vwpcaxyzfnujbto\"\n\nDecode each letter with a shift of -9.\n\nUsing the formula (ciphertext - shift) mod 26:\n\nv -> m\n\nw -> n\n\np -> g\n\nc -> t\n\na -> r\n\nx -> o\n\ny -> p\n\nz -> q\n\nf -> w\n\nn -> e\n\nu -> l\n\nj -> a\n\nb -> s\n\nt -> k\n\no -> f\n\nSo, the decoded text is: \"mngtropqwe laskf\"\n\nStill doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the assumption that the shift is 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 9 positions forward, not backward.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 9 positions.\n\nSo, for encoding, shift +9, for decoding, shift -9.\n\nBut according to standard Caesar cipher, shifting forward by 9 would require shifting backward by 9 to decode.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem meant that the encryption shift is 9, so decoding is shifting backward by 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 9 positions backward, in which case decoding would be shifting forward by 9.\n\nI need to clarify the direction of the shift.\n\nIn Caesar cipher, the shift is typically defined as how many positions to move forward in the alphabet for encryption.\n\nSo, for example, with a shift of 9:\n\na -> j\n\nb -> k\n\nc -> l\n\n...\n\nz -> i\n\nThen, to decode, you shift backward by 9 positions.\n\nSo, j -> a, k -> b, l -> c, ..., i -> z.\n\nTherefore, shifting backward by 9 positions is correct.\n\nAlternatively, in modular arithmetic, the decoding shift is equivalent to 26 - 9 = 17 positions forward.\n\nBecause (shift forward by 9) + (shift forward by 17) = shift forward by 26, which brings it back to the original letter.\n\nBut I think using shift backward by 9 is simpler.\n\nGiven that, and the previous decoding attempt resulting in \"mngtr opqwe laskf\", which doesn't make sense, perhaps there's a mistake in the ciphertext or the shift value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text is not in English or has been encrypted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not 9, but the problem clearly states the shift is 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text is shortened or uses a different language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the letters are lowercase and should remain lowercase in the plaintext.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is per word, or varies.\n\nBut",

That doesn't make sense either.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the shift is 9 positions in the encoding direction, and to decode, I need to shift backwards by 9.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculations, that gives \"ewrro\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet is considered to be from a to z, and shifting backwards by 9 means subtracting 9 from the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 9 positions in the encoding direction, and decoding is shifting forwards by 9 positions.\n\nWait, in Caesar cipher, the encoding shift is forwards in the alphabet, and decoding is backwards by the same amount.\n\nBut in this case, shifting backwards by 9 should be correct.\n\nLet me try another word.\n\n\"jbmros\"\n\nj is 10 - 9 = 1, which is \"a\"\n\nb is 2 - 9 = -7 + 26 = 19, which is \"s\"\n\nm is 13 - 9 = 4, which is \"d\"\n\nr is 18 - 9 = 9, which is \"i\"\n\no is 15 - 9 = 6, which is \"f\"\n\ns is 19 - 9 = 10, which is \"j\"\n\nSo, \"jbmros\" decodes to \"asdjfi\".

Starting at A and moving back 12 steps.\n\nA to Z is 1 step back, A to Y is 2 steps back, and so on.\n\nSo:\n\nA -> Z (1 step back)\n\nZ -> Y (2 steps back)\n\n...\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\nA (1): -12 would be to count 12 letters before A in the alphabet, wrapping around.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a Caesar cipher with a shift of 12, the decoding shift is also 12 (since shifting forward by 12 and then backward by 12 brings us back to the original).\n\nSo, to decode, I can use the formula:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - shift) mod 26\n\nWhere A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll use the alphabetical positions where A=1 to Z=26.\n\nSo, for each letter in the ciphertext, I'll find its position, subtract 12, and if the result is less than 1, I'll add 26 to wrap around.\n\nLet's try this systemically.\n\nCiphertext: axwemp figciqv\n\nI'll treat this as a single word: \"axwempfigciqv\"\n\nBut for clarity, I'll keep the space in mind, but since spaces are not encoded in Caesar ciphers, I'll assume the space is just for readability.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the positions of each letter:\n\na: 1\n\nx: 24\n\nw: 23\n\ne: 5\n\nm: 13\n\np: 16\n\nf: 6\n\ni: 9\n\ng: 7\n\nc: 3\n\ni: 9\n\nq: 17\n\nv: 22\n\nNow, subtract 12 from each:\n\na: 1 - 12 = -11 → -11 + 26 = 15 → O\n\nx: 24 - 12 = 12 → L\n\nw: 23 - 12 = 11 → K\n\ne: 5 - 12 = -7 → -7 + 26 = 19 → S\n\nm: 13 - 12 = 1 → A\n\np: 16 - 12 = 4 → D\n\nf: 6 - 12 = -6 → -6 + 26 = 20 → T\n\ni: 9 - 12 = -3 → -3 + 26 = 23 → W\n\ng: 7 - 12 = -5 → -5 + 26 = 21 → U\n\nc: 3 - 12 = -9 → -9 + 26 = 17 → R\n\ni: 9 - 12 = -3 → -3 + 26 = 23 → W\n\nq: 17 - 12 = 5 → E\n\nv: 22 - 12 = 10 → J\n\nSo, the decoded letters are:\n\nO L K S A D T W U R W E J\n\nNow, let's see if this makes sense as a word or phrase.\n\nPutting them together: OLKSWADTWUREWJ\n\nThis doesn't seem to make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the decoding process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 12 positions forward in the alphabet, not backward.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 12 positions.\n\nSo, for each letter in the ciphertext, I'll add 12 to its position and wrap around if necessary.\n\nUsing the same positions as before:\n\na: 1 + 12 = 13 → M\n\nx: 24 + 12 = 36 → 36 - 26 = 10 → J\n\nw: 23 + 12 = 35 → 35 - 26 = 9 → I\n\ne: 5 + 12 = 17 → Q\n\nm: 13 + 12 = 25 → Y\n\np: 16 + 12 = 28 → 28 - 26 = 2 → B\n\nf: 6 + 12 = 18 → R\n\ni: 9 + 12 = 21 → U\n\ng: 7 + 12 = 19 → S\n\nc: 3 + 12 = 15 → O\n\ni: 9 + 12 = 21 → U\n\nq: 17 + 12 = 29 → 29 - 26 = 3 → C\n\nv: 22 + 12 = 34 → 34 - 26 = 8 → H\n\nSo, the decoded letters are:\n\nM J I Q Y B R U S O U C H\n\nPutting them together: MJ IQ YBR U SOU C H\n\nThis also doesn't seem to make sense. Maybe the shift is not 12, or perhaps the ciphertext has been encoded differently.\n\nWait, the instruction clearly says the shift is 12, and it's a Caesar cipher, which typically shifts letters forward in the alphabet. So, shifting forward by 12 positions.\n\nBut neither shifting forward nor backward by 12 positions seems to produce a meaningful plaintext.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the alphabet is considered circular, and handle the wrapping around correctly.\n\nLet me try again, more carefully.\n\nTaking the first letter: a (1)\n\nShift forward by 12: 1 + 12 = 13 → M\n\nSecond letter: x (24)\n\n24 + 12 = 36 → 36 - 26 = 10 → J\n\nThird letter: w (23)\n\n23 + 12 = 35 → 35 - 26 = 9 → I\n\nFourth letter: e (5)\n\n5 + 12 = 17 → Q\n\nFifth letter: m (13)\n\n13 + 12 = 25 → Y\n\nSixth letter: p (16)\n\n16 + 12 = 28 → 28 - 26 = 2 → B\n\nSeventh letter: f (6)\n\n6 + 12 = 18 → R\n\nEighth letter: i (9)\n\n9 + 12 = 21 → U\n\nNinth letter: g (7)\n\n7 + 12 = 19 → S\n\nTenth letter: c (3)\n\n3 + 12 = 15 → O\n\nEleventh letter: i (9)\n\n9 + 12 = 21 → U\n\nTwelfth letter: q (17)\n\n17 + 12 = 29 → 29 - 26 = 3 → C\n\nThirteenth letter: v (22)\n\n22 + 12 = 34 → 34 - 26 = 8 → H\n\nSo, the decoded plaintext is: MJ IQ YBR U SOU C H\n\nThis still doesn't make sense.

In this case, since the shift is 12, I need to shift each letter back by 12 positions to get the original letter.\n\nI'll create a simple mapping or use the modulo operation to handle the wrap-around when shifting back. The alphabet has 26 letters, so shifting back by 12 is equivalent to shifting forward by 14 (since 26 - 12 = 14). But I'll stick to shifting back by 12 for clarity.\n\nLet's decode each letter in the first word \"sdqybxuz\":\n\n- s -> shift back 12: s is the 19th letter (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26). 19 - 12 = 7, which is g.\n\n- d -> 4th letter. 4 - 12 = -8.

Maybe I made a mistake in the decoding process. Let me double-check the shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is actually 12 positions forward instead of backward. Let's try that.\n\nEncoding with a shift of 12 would mean shifting letters forward by 12 positions, and decoding would involve shifting back by 12 positions. But in the Caesar cipher, the encoding and decoding shifts are inverses of each other. So, if the shift for encoding is 12, the shift for decoding is also 12 in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, actually, in the Caesar cipher, the encoding and decoding shifts are the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, if the encoding shift is 12 positions to the right, decoding is 12 positions to the left.\n\nBut in the initial approach, I shifted back by 12 positions, and the result was \"gremlpin zorfly kout\", which doesn't seem to make sense. Maybe the shift value is different, or perhaps there's a mistake in the decoding process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text is not entirely in lowercase letters, or there are punctuation marks. But in this case, it seems to be all lowercase letters.\n\nLet me try decoding again, more carefully.\n\nTake the first word \"sdqybxuz\":\n\n- s (19) -12 = 7 -> g\n\n- d (4) -12 = -8 +26=18 -> r\n\n- q (17) -12=5 -> e\n\n- y (25) -12=13 -> m\n\n- b (2) -12=-10+26=16 -> p\n\n- x (24) -12=12 -> l\n\n- u (21) -12=9 -> i\n\n- z (26) -12=14 -> n\n\nSo, \"sdqybxuz\" -> \"gremlpin\"\n\nSecond word \"ladrkx\":\n\n- l (12) -12=0 -> z\n\n- a (1) -12=-11+26=15 -> o\n\n- d (4) -12=-8+26=18 -> r\n\n- r (18) -12=6 -> f\n\n- k (11) -12=-1+26=25 -> y\n\n- x (24) -12=12 -> l\n\nSo, \"ladrkx\" -> \"zorfly\"\n\nThird word \"wagf\":\n\n- w (23) -12=11 -> k\n\n- a (1) -12=-11+26=15 -> o\n\n- g (7) -12=-5+26=21 -> u\n\n- f (6) -12=-6+26=20 -> t\n\nSo, \"wagf\" -> \"kout\"\n\nStill, \"gremlpin zorfly kout\" doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift is actually 12 positions in the opposite direction, meaning the encoding shift was 12 to the left, so decoding should be 12 to the right.\n\nLet's try shifting each letter forward by 12 positions.\n\nFirst word \"sdqybxuz\":\n\n- s (19) +12=31-26=5 -> e\n\n- d (4) +12=16 -> p\n\n- q (17) +12=29-26=3 -> c\n\n- y (25) +12=37-26=11 -> k\n\n- b (2) +12=14 -> n\n\n- x (24) +12=36-26=10 -> j\n\n- u (21) +12=33-26=7 -> g\n\n- z (26) +12=38-26=12 -> l\n\nSo, \"sdqybxuz\" -> \"epcknjgl\"\n\nSecond word \"ladrkx\":\n\n- l (12) +12=24 -> x\n\n- a (1) +12=13 -> m\n\n- d (4) +12=16 -> p\n\n- r (18) +12=30-26=4 -> d\n\n- k (11) +12=23 -> w\n\n- x (24) +12=36-26=10 -> j\n\nSo, \"ladrkx\" -> \"xmpdwj\"\n\nThird word \"wagf\":\n\n- w (23) +12=35-26=9 -> i\n\n- a (1) +12=13 -> m\n\n- g (7) +12=19 -> s\n\n- f (6) +12=18 -> r\n\nSo, \"wagf\" -> \"imsr\"\n\nNow, \"epcknjgl xmpdwj imsr\" still doesn't make sense.

Since it's negative, I'll add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet): -10 + 26 = 16, Q.\n\n\"P\" is the 16th letter: 16 - 12 = 4, D.\n\n\"M\" is the 13th letter: 13 - 12 = 1, A.\n\nSo, \"otubpm\" decodes to \"chidqa\".\n\nWait, but \"b\" is the 2nd letter, 2 - 12 = -10, which is 16, Q. That seems correct.\n\nNow, \"huzomx\":\n\nH is 8: 8 - 12 = -4 + 26 = 22, V.\n\nU is 21: 21 - 12 = 9, I.\n\nZ is 26: 26 - 12 = 14, N.\n\nO is 15: 15 - 12 = 3, C.\n\nM is 13: 13 - 12 = 1, A.\n\nX is 24: 24 - 12 = 12, L.\n\nSo, \"huzomx\" decodes to \"vincal\".\n\nNext, \"vmzfdarr\":\n\nV is 22: 22 - 12 = 10, J.\n\nM is 13: 13 - 12 = 1, A.\n\nZ is 26: 26 - 12 = 14, N.\n\nF is 6: 6 - 12 = -6 + 26 = 20, T.\n\nD is 4: 4 - 12 = -8 + 26 = 18, R.\n\nA is 1: 1 - 12 = -11 + 26 = 15, O.\n\nR is 18: 18 - 12 = 6, F.\n\nR is 18: 18 - 12 = 6, F.\n\nSo, \"vmzfdarr\" decodes to \"jantroff\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"chidqa vincal jantroff\"\n\nBut this doesn't seem to make much sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the decoding process.\n\nLet me double-check the shift. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 12 means that each letter is shifted forward by 12 positions in the alphabet for encryption. Therefore, to decode, I need to shift back by 12 positions.\n\nAlternatively, since the shift is 12, and the alphabet has 26 letters, shifting forward by 12 is equivalent to shifting backward by 14 (because 26 - 12 = 14). But it's clearer to think of it as shifting back by 12.\n\nLet me try decoding \"otubpm huzomx vmzfdarr\" again.\n\nStarting with \"otubpm\":\n\nO -> C (15 - 12 = 3)\n\nT -> H (20 - 12 = 8)\n\nU -> I (21 - 12 = 9)\n\nB -> Q (2 - 12 = -10 + 26 = 16)\n\nP -> D (16 - 12 = 4)\n\nM -> A (13 - 12 = 1)\n\nSo, \"otubpm\" is \"chidqa\".\n\n\"huzomx\":\n\nH -> V (8 - 12 = -4 + 26 = 22)\n\nU -> I (21 - 12 = 9)\n\nZ -> N (26 - 12 = 14)\n\nO -> C (15 - 12 = 3)\n\nM -> A (13 - 12 = 1)\n\nX -> L (24 - 12 = 12)\n\nSo, \"huzomx\" is \"vincal\".\n\n\"vmzfdarr\":\n\nV -> J (22 - 12 = 10)\n\nM -> A (13 - 12 = 1)\n\nZ -> N (26 - 12 = 14)\n\nF -> T (6 - 12 = -6 + 26 = 20)\n\nD -> R (4 - 12 = -8 + 26 = 18)\n\nA -> O (1 - 12 = -11 + 26 = 15)\n\nR -> F (18 - 12 = 6)\n\nR -> F (18 - 12 = 6)\n\nSo, \"vmzfdarr\" is \"jantroff\".\n\nCombining them: \"chidqa vincal jantroff\"\n\nThis still doesn't make sense. Maybe the ciphertext is divided into words differently.\n\nLet me try dividing it differently:\n\n\"otub pm hu zomx vm zfdarr\"\n\nDecoding each part:\n\n\"otub\" -> \"chid\"\n\n\"pm\" -> \"da\"\n\n\"hu\" -> \"vi\"\n\n\"zomx\" -> \"nical\"\n\n\"vm\" -> \"ja\"\n\n\"zfdarr\" -> \"ntroff\"\n\nSo, \"chid da vi nical ja ntroff\"\n\nStill not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ciphertext is \"otubpmhuzomxvmzfdarr\" without spaces.\n\nLet me try decoding the entire string without spaces.\n\n\"otubpmhuzomxvmzfdarr\"\n\nDecoding each letter:\n\nO->C\n\nT->H\n\nU->I\n\nB->Q\n\nP->D\n\nM->A\n\nH->V\n\nU->I\n\nZ->N\n\nO->C\n\nM->A\n\nX->L\n\nV->J\n\nM->A\n\nZ->N\n\nF->T\n\nD->R\n\nA->O\n\nR->F\n\nR->F\n\nSo, the plaintext is \"chidqavinicajantroff\"\n\nThis seems like a single word, which doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the spaces were incorrectly placed in the ciphertext.\n\nLet me try to rearrange the spaces.\n\nIf I insert spaces differently:\n\n\"ot ub pm hu zom xvm zfd arr\"\n\nDecoding:\n\nO->C\n\nT->H\n\nU->I\n\nB->Q\n\nP->D\n\nM->A\n\nH->V\n\nU->I\n\nZ->N\n\nO->C\n\nM->A\n\nX->L\n\nV->J\n\nM->A\n\nZ->N\n\nF->T\n\nD->R\n\nA->O\n\nR->F\n\nR->F\n\nSo, \"ch id qd a vi n c a j a n t r o f f\"\n\nStill not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is not 12.

I'll decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, since the shift is 12, I'll be shifting back by 12 positions to get the original plaintext.\n\nI should also consider that the alphabet wraps around, so if I go past 'a' while shifting back, I'll loop back to 'z'. Also, I need to make sure to only decode alphabetical characters and leave any non-alphabetical characters as they are, although in this ciphertext, it seems all characters are letters.\n\nLet's start decoding each letter one by one.\n\n1. e -> shift back 12: e is the 5th letter. 5 - 12 = -7. Since it's negative, I'll add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet): -7 + 26 = 19, which is 's'.\n\n2. u -> 21st letter. 21 - 12 = 9, which is 'i'.\n\n3. i -> 9th letter. 9 - 12 = -3 + 26 = 23, which is 'w'.\n\n4. u -> same as above, 'w'.\n\n5. z -> 26th letter. 26 - 12 = 14, which is 'n'.\n\n6. p -> 16th letter. 16 - 12 = 4, which is 'd'.\n\nSo, \"euiuzp\" decodes to \"siwwnd\".\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.

I'll keep it as is.\n\nNext, \"a\":\n\n- a is the 1st letter.\n\n- 1 - 12 = -11.\n\n- -11 + 26 = 15.\n\n- The 15th letter is \"o\".\n\nThen, \"b\":\n\n- b is the 2nd letter.\n\n- 2 - 12 = -10.\n\n- -10 + 26 = 16.\n\n- The 16th letter is \"p\".\n\nNext, \"u\":\n\n- u is the 21st letter.\n\n- 21 - 12 = 9.\n\n- The 9th letter is \"i\".\n\nThen, \"h\":\n\n- h is the 8th letter.\n\n- 8 - 12 = -4.\n\n- -4 + 26 = 22.\n\n- The 22nd letter is \"v\".\n\nNext, \"z\":\n\n- z is the 26th letter.\n\n- 26 - 12 = 14.\n\n- The 14th letter is \"n\".\n\nNext, space again.\n\nThen, \"y\":\n\n- y is the 25th letter.\n\n- 25 - 12 = 13.\n\n- The 13th letter is \"m\".\n\nNext, \"p\":\n\n- p is the 16th letter.\n\n- 16 - 12 = 4.\n\n- The 4th letter is \"d\".\n\nThen, \"f\":\n\n- f is the 6th letter.\n\n- 6 - 12 = -6.\n\n- -6 + 26 = 20.\n\n- The 20th letter is \"t\".\n\nNext, \"m\":\n\n- m is the 13th letter.\n\n- 13 - 12 = 1.\n\n- The 1st letter is \"a\".\n\nFinally, \"d\":\n\n- d is the 4th letter.\n\n- 4 - 12 = -8.\n\n- -8 + 26 = 18.\n\n- The 18th letter is \"r\".\n\nPutting it all together, the decoded plaintext is \"qwlar opivn mdtar\".\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to make much sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the decoding process. Let me double-check the shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ciphertext was encoded with a forward shift of 12, and I'm trying to decode it with a backward shift of 12. Wait, in Caesar cipher, decoding is indeed shifting back by the same amount used in encoding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the alphabet is considered to be modulo 26. Let me try recalculating a few letters that wrapped around.\n\nTake \"c\" again:\n\n- c is 3.\n\n- 3 - 12 = -9.\n\n- -9 mod 26 = 17.\n\n- 17th letter is \"q\".

Maybe there's a mistake in assuming the shift is 12, or perhaps the ciphertext has been encoded differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ciphertext is case-sensitive, but in this case, all letters are lowercase, so that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet includes only lowercase letters, and wrapping around is correctly handled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is not 12, but -12, meaning that the encoding was done by shifting backwards by 12, in which case decoding would be shifting forwards by 12.\n\nLet me try shifting forwards by 12 positions.\n\nStarting with \"c\":\n\n- c is 3.\n\n- 3 + 12 = 15.\n\n- 15th letter is \"o\".\n\n\"i\":\n\n- i is 9.\n\n- 9 + 12 = 21.\n\n- 21st letter is \"u\".\n\n\"x\":\n\n- x is 24.\n\n- 24 + 12 = 36.\n\n- 36 - 26 = 10.\n\n- 10th letter is \"j\".\n\n\"m\":\n\n- m is 13.\n\n- 13 + 12 = 25.\n\n- 25th letter is \"y\".\n\n\"d\":\n\n- d is 4.\n\n- 4 + 12 = 16.\n\n- 16th letter is \"p\".\n\nSpace.\n\n\"a\":\n\n- a is 1.\n\n- 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n- 13th letter is \"m\".\n\n\"b\":\n\n- b is 2.\n\n- 2 + 12 = 14.\n\n- 14th letter is \"n\".\n\n\"u\":\n\n- u is 21.\n\n- 21 + 12 = 33.\n\n- 33 - 26 = 7.\n\n- 7th letter is \"g\".\n\n\"h\":\n\n- h is 8.\n\n- 8 + 12 = 20.\n\n- 20th letter is \"t\".\n\n\"z\":\n\n- z is 26.\n\n- 26 + 12 = 38.\n\n- 38 - 26 = 12.\n\n- 12th letter is \"l\".\n\nSpace.\n\n\"y\":\n\n- y is 25.\n\n- 25 + 12 = 37.\n\n- 37 - 26",

Let's take the ciphertext \"wxlia yznho ciqfa\" and decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the alphabet and how the shifting works. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, since the shift is 12, I need to shift each letter back by 12 positions to get the original letter.\n\nI'll create a mapping of each letter to its decoded counterpart. The alphabet has 26 letters, so shifting back by 12 is equivalent to shifting forward by 14 positions (since 26 - 12 = 14). However, I'll stick to shifting back by 12 for clarity.\n\nLet's start with the first word: \"wxlia\"\n\n- w shifted back by 12: w is the 23rd letter. 23 - 12 = 11, which is k.\n\n- x shifted back by 12: x is the 24th letter. 24 - 12 = 12, which is l.\n\n- l shifted back by 12: l is the 12th letter. 12 - 12 = 0, which wraps around to z (since there is no 0th letter).\n\n- i shifted back by 12: i is the 9th letter. 9 - 12 = -3, which wraps around to the 23rd letter, which is w.\n\n- a shifted back by 12: a is the 1st letter. 1 - 12 = -11, which wraps around to the 15th letter, which is o.\n\nSo, \"wxlia\" decodes to \"kllwo\".\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the wrapping around.\n\nFor letters that go below a, I need to wrap around to the end of the alphabet. So, for example:\n\n- l is 12, 12 - 12 = 0, which should be z.\n\n- i is 9, 9 - 12 = -3, which should be 26 - 3 = 23, which is w.\n\n- a is 1, 1 - 12 = -11, which should be 26 - 11 = 15, which is o.\n\nSo, \"wxlia\" should be \"k l z w o\", which is \"klzwo\". But I had \"kllwo\" earlier, which was a mistake.\n\nLet me write it correctly:\n\nw (23) - 12 = 11 -> k\n\nx (24) - 12 = 12 -> l\n\nl (12) - 12 = 0 -> z\n\ni (9) - 12 = -3 -> 26 - 3 = 23 -> w\n\na (1) - 12 = -11 -> 26 - 11 = 15 -> o\n\nSo, \"wxlia\" decodes to \"klzwo\".\n\nNow, the second word: \"yznho\"\n\n- y shifted back by 12: y is 25. 25 - 12 = 13 -> m\n\n- z shifted back by 12: z is 26. 26 - 12 = 14 -> n\n\n- n shifted back by 12: n is 14. 14 - 12 = 2 -> b\n\n- h shifted back by 12: h is 8. 8 - 12 = -4 -> 26 - 4 = 22 -> v\n\n- o shifted back by 12: o is 15. 15 - 12 = 3 -> c\n\nSo, \"yznho\" decodes to \"mnbvc\".\n\nThird word: \"ciqfa\"\n\n- c shifted back by 12: c is 3. 3 - 12 = -9 -> 26 - 9 = 17 -> r\n\n- i shifted back by 12: i is 9. 9 - 12 = -3 -> 26 - 3 = 23 -> w\n\n- q shifted back by 12: q is 17. 17 - 12 = 5 -> e\n\n- f shifted back by 12: f is 6. 6 - 12 = -6 -> 26 - 6 = 20 -> t\n\n- a shifted back by 12: a is 1. 1 - 12 = -11 -> 26 - 11 = 15 -> o\n\nSo, \"ciqfa\" decodes to \"rwe to\".\n\nWait, I think I miscounted the positions. Let's verify:\n\nc is the 3rd letter: 3 - 12 = -9, 26 - 9 = 17 -> r\n\ni is the 9th letter: 9 - 12 = -3, 26 - 3 = 23 -> w\n\nq is the 17th letter: 17 - 12 = 5 -> e\n\nf is the 6th letter: 6 - 12 = -6, 26 - 6 = 20 -> t\n\na is the 1st letter: 1 - 12 = -11, 26 - 11 = 15 -> o\n\nSo, \"ciqfa\" decodes to \"r w e t o\", which seems like \"r wet o\" or perhaps \"r we to\". But it's probably \"r wet o\".\n\nNow, combining all the decoded words:\n\n\"klzwo mnbvc r wet o\"\n\nThis doesn't seem to make much sense.

Maybe the shift is not 12, or perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is 12 positions forward, not backward. Let's try shifting forward by 12.\n\nUsing the same alphabet:\n\na -> m\n\nb -> n\n\nc -> o\n\nd -> p\n\ne -> q\n\nf -> r\n\ng -> s\n\nh -> t\n\ni -> u\n\nj -> v\n\nk -> w\n\nl -> x\n\nm -> y\n\nn -> z\n\no -> a\n\np -> b\n\nq -> c\n\nr -> d\n\ns -> e\n\nt -> f\n\nu -> g\n\nv -> h\n\nw -> i\n\nx -> j\n\ny -> k\n\nz -> l\n\nNow, decode \"wxlia yznho ciqfa\" with shift forward 12.\n\nFirst word: wxlia\n\nw -> i\n\nx -> j\n\nl -> x\n\ni -> u\n\na -> m\n\nSo, \"wxlia\" is \"ijxum\"\n\nSecond word: yznho\n\ny -> k\n\nz -> l\n\nn -> z\n\nh -> f\n\no -> a\n\nSo, \"yznho\" is \"klzfa\"\n\nThird word: ciqfa\n\nc -> o\n\ni -> u\n\nq -> c\n\nf -> r\n\na -> m\n\nSo, \"ciqfa\" is \"oucrm\"\n\nCombined: \"ijxum klzfa oucrm\"\n\nStill doesn't make sense.

Let me check my calculations.\n\nActually, when shifting back by 12, I can also think of it as shifting forward by 14 (since 26 - 12 = 14). That might be easier.\n\nLet's try again:\n\n- 'u' shifted forward by 14: u is 21, 21 + 14 = 35. 35 - 26 = 9, which is 'i' (same as before)\n\n- 'q' shifted forward by 14: q is 17, 17 + 14 = 31, 31 - 26 = 5, which is 'e'\n\n- 'a' shifted forward by 14: a is 1, 1 + 14 = 15, which is 'o'\n\n- 'g' shifted forward by 14: g is 7, 7 + 14 = 21, which is 'u'\n\n- 'd' shifted forward by 14: d is 4, 4 + 14 = 18, which is 'r'\n\nSo, \"uqagd\" is \"ieour\". But \"ieour\" doesn't seem like a meaningful word. Maybe I made a mistake in the shifting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the shift is 12 positions back, not forward. Let's stick to the original approach.\n\n- 'u' - 12: u is 21, 21 - 12 = 9, 'i'\n\n- 'q' - 12: q is 17, 17 - 12 = 5, 'e'\n\n- 'a' - 12: a is 1, 1 - 12 = -11, wrap around: 26 - 11 = 15, 'o'\n\n- 'g' - 12: g is 7, 7 - 12 = -5, wrap around: 26 - 5 = 21, 'u'\n\n- 'd' - 12: d is 4, 4 - 12 = -8, wrap around: 26 - 8 = 18, 'r'\n\nAgain, \"ieour\". Hmm, maybe it's a typo in the ciphertext or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check another word: \"ciqdf\"\n\n- 'c' - 12: c is 3, 3 - 12 = -9, wrap around: 26 - 9 = 17, 'q'\n\n- 'i' - 12: i is 9, 9 - 12 = -3, wrap around: 26 - 3 = 23, 'w'\n\n- 'q' - 12: q is 17, 17 - 12 = 5, 'e'\n\n- 'd' - 12: d is 4, 4 - 12 = -8, wrap around: 26 - 8 = 18, 'r'\n\n- 'f' - 12: f is 6, 6 - 12 = -6, wrap around: 26 - 6 = 20, 't'\n\nSo, \"ciqdf\" decodes to \"qwert\". That seems like typing keys rather than a meaningful word. This is odd.\n\nLet's try the third word: \"mepdqb\"\n\n- 'm' - 12: m is 13, 13 - 12 = 1, 'a'\n\n- 'e' - 12: e is 5, 5 - 12 = -7, wrap around: 26 - 7 = 19, 's'\n\n- 'p' - 12: p is 16, 16 - 12 = 4, 'd'\n\n- 'd' - 12: d is 4, 4 - 12 = -8, wrap around: 26 - 8 = 18, 'r'\n\n- 'q' - 12: q is 17, 17 - 12 = 5, 'e'\n\n- 'b' - 12: b is 2, 2 - 12 = -10, wrap around: 26 - 10 = 16, 'p'\n\nSo, \"mepdqb\" decodes to \"asedep\". Again, not a meaningful word.\n\nLast word: \"yxbaw\"\n\n- 'y' - 12: y is 25, 25 - 12 = 13, 'm'\n\n- 'x' - 12: x is 24, 24 - 12 = 12, 'l'\n\n- 'b' - 12: b is 2, 2 - 12 = -10, wrap around: 26 - 10 = 16, 'p'\n\n- 'a' - 12: a is 1, 1 - 12 = -11, wrap around: 26 - 11 = 15, 'o'\n\n- 'w' - 12: w is 23, 23 - 12 = 11, 'k'\n\nSo, \"yxbaw\" decodes to \"mlpok\".\n\nPutting it all together, the decoded message is: \"ieour qwert asedep mlpok\"\n\nThis doesn't make sense.

I'll handle both uppercase and lowercase letters, and non-alphabetic characters will remain unchanged.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the Caesar cipher works. In a Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, the shift is 12 positions back.\n\nI'll create a function to decode each character:\n\n1. For lowercase letters:\n   - Original position: `a` to `z`, which correspond to positions 0 to 25.\n   - New position: (original position - 12) mod 26.\n\n2.

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.\n\nGiven the ciphertext \"ljoyq vfqd\", we will decode it by shifting each letter back by 12 positions.\n\nLet's start with the first word \"ljoyq\":\n\n1. l -> shift back 12: l is the 12th letter. Subtracting 12: 12 - 12 = 0, which wraps around to z (since a is 1).\n   - But in Caesar cipher, wrapping around is straightforward. The alphabet is considered to be circular.\n   - So, l (12) - 12 = 0, which is z.\n\n2. j -> shift back 12: j is the 10th letter. 10 - 12 = -2. Wrap around: 26 - 2 = 24, which is x.\n\n3. o -> shift back 12: o is the 15th letter. 15 - 12 = 3, which is c.\n\n4. y -> shift back 12: y is the 25th letter. 25 - 12 = 13, which is m.\n\n5. q -> shift back 12: q is the 17th letter. 17 - 12 = 5, which is e.\n\nSo, \"ljoyq\" decodes to \"zxcm e\". Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's check the positions again.\n\nActually, the alphabet positions are:\n\n- a:1, b:2, ..., z:26.\n\nSo, to shift back 12, we can also think of adding 14 (since 26 - 12 = 14), which is equivalent to shifting forward 14 positions.\n\nLet's try that:\n\n1. l (12) -12 or +14: 12 +14=26, which is z.\n\n2. j (10) +14=24, which is x.\n\n3. o (15) +14=29-26=3, which is c.\n\n4. y (25) +14=39-26=13, which is m.\n\n5. q (17) +14=31-26=5, which is e.\n\nSo, \"ljoyq\" decodes to \"zxcm e\", but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is to the left by 12, meaning subtracting 12 from each letter's position.\n\nLet's try subtracting 12 directly, wrapping around if necessary.\n\n1. l (12) -12=0 → z.\n\n2. j (10) -12=-2 → 26 -2=24 → x.\n\n3. o (15) -12=3 → c.\n\n4. y (25) -12=13 → m.\n\n5. q (17) -12=5 → e.\n\nAgain, \"zxcm e\", which doesn't seem like a meaningful word. Maybe there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me try another way: to decode a Caesar cipher with a shift of 12, I can think of it as shifting the letters by -12 positions or, equivalently, shifting by +14 positions (since 26 -12=14).\n\nSo, shifting forward by 14 positions.\n\nLet's apply that:\n\n1. l (12) +14=26 → z.\n\n2. j (10) +14=24 → x.\n\n3. o (15) +14=29-26=3 → c.\n\n4. y (25) +14=39-26=13 → m.\n\n5. q (17) +14=31-26=5 → e.\n\nAgain, \"zxcm e\". Still doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the shift is actually 12 to the right for encoding, so to decode, we need to shift 12 to the left.\n\nWait, the original instruction says \"shift is 12\", but it doesn't specify direction. In Caesar cipher, shift can be to the left or right.\n\nPerhaps in this case, a shift of 12 means shifting right by 12 for encoding, so decoding would require shifting left by 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is always to the right, regardless of encoding or decoding.\n\nI need to clarify that.\n\nIn standard Caesar cipher, if encoding with a right shift of N, then decoding is a left shift of N.\n\nSo, if the shift is 12 to the right for encoding, then to decode, we shift 12 to the left.\n\nAlternatively, shifting right by (26 - N) is equivalent to shifting left by N.\n\nSo, shifting right by 14 is equivalent to shifting left by 12.\n\nBut in this case, both approaches give the same result, which is \"zxcm e\", which doesn't seem correct.\n\nMaybe the ciphertext is not entirely letters, or there's a mistake in the ciphertext itself.\n\nLet's check the second word \"vfqd\":\n\n1. v -> shift back 12: v is 22. 22 -12=10 → j.\n\n2. f -> 6. 6 -12=-6 → 26 -6=20 → t.\n\n3. q -> 17. 17 -12=5 → e.\n\n4. d -> 4. 4 -12=-8 → 26 -8=18 → r.\n\nSo, \"vfqd\" decodes to \"jter\".\n\nCombining both words: \"zxcm e jter\". That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is different, or maybe the ciphertext is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 12 positions, but in the opposite direction.\n\nLet me try shifting right by 12 instead of left.\n\nFor the first word \"ljoyq\":\n\n1. l (12) +12=24 → x.\n\n2. j (10) +12=22 → v.\n\n3. o (15) +12=27-26=1 → a.\n\n4. y (25) +12=37-26=11 → k.\n\n5. q (17) +12=29-26=3 → c.\n\nSo, \"ljoyq\" becomes \"xvakc\".\n\nThat doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 12 positions in the opposite direction for decoding.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is 12 for encoding, and to decode, it's -12.\n\nBut in Caesar cipher, shifting by N for encoding means shifting by -N for decoding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 12 positions to the left for encoding, so decoding would be 12 positions to the right.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nEncoding: shift left by 12.\n\nDecoding: shift right by 12.\n\nSo, for \"ljoyq\":\n\n1. l (12) -12=0 → z.\n\n2. j (10) -12=-2 → 26 -2=24 → x.\n\n3. o (15) -12=3 → c.\n\n4. y (25) -12=13 → m.\n\n5. q (17) -12=5 → e.\n\nAgain, \"zxcm e\".\n\nStill doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 12 positions, but the alphabet is considered differently.\n\nMaybe it's a Caesar cipher with a shift of 12, and the alphabet is considered wrapping around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ciphertext is incorrect or contains non-alphabetic characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not 12, but the instruction is misstated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 12 positions, but it's a Vigenere cipher or something more complex.\n\nBut the instruction specifies a Caesar cipher with a shift of 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plaintext is in a different language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the ciphertext.\n\nGiven that, I'll assume the ciphertext is correct and proceed with shifting back by 12 positions.\n\nSo, \"ljoyq vfqd\" decodes to \"zxcm e jter\".\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in English.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the words are run together without spaces.\n\nLet's try decoding \"ljoyqvfqd\":\n\n1. l -> z\n\n2. j -> x\n\n3. o -> c\n\n4. y -> m\n\n5. q -> e\n\n6. v -> j\n\n7. f -> t\n\n8. q -> e\n\n9. d -> r\n\nSo, \"zxcm ejter\".\n\nStill doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's \"help me\".\n\nLet's encode \"help me\" with a shift of 12.\n\nh (8) +12=20 → t\n\ne (5) +12=17 → q\n\nl (12) +12=24 → x\n\np (16) +12=28-26=2 → b\n\nSpace remains space.\n\nm",
