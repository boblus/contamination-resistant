Maybe the shift is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 positions forward, not backward.\n\nLet's try shifting forward by 3:\n\n- n (13) + 3 = 16 → q\n- l (11) + 3 = 14 → o\n- q (16) + 3 = 19 → t\n- g (6) + 3 = 9 → i\n- q (16) + 3 = 19 → t\n- h (7) + 3 = 10 → k\n- v (21) + 3 = 24 → x\n- v (21) + 3 = 24 → x\n\nSo, \"nlqgqhvv\" -> \"qoitkxx\"\n\nThat doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is 3, but the direction is different.\n\nLet's try shifting backward by 3 again, but check each letter carefully.\n\n- n -> k (n -> m -> l -> k)\n- l -> i (l -> k -> j -> i)\n- q -> n (q -> p -> o -> n)\n- g -> d (g -> f -> e -> d)\n- q -> n (same as above)\n- h -> e (h -> g -> f -> e)\n- v -> s (v -> u -> t -> s)\n- v -> s (same as above)\n\nSo, \"nlqgqhvv\" -> \"kndenes\"\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is different for some letters, or perhaps it's not a Caesar cipher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 positions in the other direction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the shift in terms of the alphabet position.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\n\nCreate a Caesar cipher decoder function.\n\nLet's assume the shift is 3.\n\nDefine the alphabet:\n\nalphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n\n shifted_alphabet = alphabet[-3:] + alphabet[:-3] -> \"defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc\"\n\nWait, that's for encoding.\n\nFor decoding, we need to map the shifted letters back to the original letters.\n\nSo, if the shift is 3, the encoding would be:\n\na -> d\n\nb -> e\n\nc -> f\n\n...\n\nw -> z\n\nx -> a\n\ny -> b\n\nz -> c\n\nTherefore, to decode, we need to map:\n\nd -> a\n\ne -> b\n\nf -> c\n\n...\n\nz -> w\n\na -> x\n\nb -> y\n\nc -> z\n\nSo, in general, for decoding, we shift back by 3 positions.\n\nGiven that, let's create a decoding table.\n\nDecoding table:\n\nciphertext plaintext\n\na d\n\nb e\n\nc f\n\nd g\n\ne h\n\nf i\n\ng j\n\nh k\n\ni l\n\nj m\n\nk n\n\nl o\n\nm p\n\nn q\n\no r\n\np s\n\nq t\n\nr u\n\ns v\n\nt w\n\nu x\n\nv y\n\nw z\n\nx a\n\ny b\n\nz c\n\nSo, for \"nlqgqhvv\":\n\nn -> k\n\nl -> i\n\nq -> n\n\ng -> d\n\nq -> n\n\nh -> e\n\nv -> s\n\nv -> s\n\nSo, \"k i n d n e s s\"\n\nSo, \"kindness\"\n\nOkay, that seems better.\n\nNow, the full ciphertext is \"nlqgqhvv frvwv qrwklqj\"\n\nDecoding each part:\n\n\"nlqgqhvv\" -> \"kindness\"\n\n\"frvwv\" -> ?\n\nf -> c\n\nr -> o\n\nv -> s\n\nw -> t\n\nv -> s\n\nSo, \"cos ts\"\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, using the decoding table:\n\nf -> c\n\nr -> o\n\nv -> s\n\nw -> t\n\nv -> s\n\nSo, \"frvwv\" -> \"cosot\"\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the decoding table.\n\nWait, let's double-check the decoding table.\n\nDecoding table should be:\n\nciphertext plaintext\n\na x\n\nb y\n\nc z\n\nd a\n\ne b\n\nf c\n\ng d\n\nh e\n\ni f\n\nj g\n\nk h\n\nl i\n\nm j\n\nn k\n\no l\n\np m\n\nq n\n\nr o\n\ns p\n\nt q\n\nu r\n\nv s\n\nw t\n\nx u\n\ny v\n\nz w\n\nWait, I think I got it wrong earlier.\n\nTo decode a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3, we need to shift the letters back by 3 positions.\n\nSo, in Python, you can do:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - 3) mod 26\n\nSo, for example:\n\na (0) - 3 = -3 mod 26 = 23 → x\n\nb (1) - 3 = -2 mod 26 = 24 → y\n\nc (2) - 3 = -1 mod 26 = 25 → z\n\nd (3) - 3 = 0 → a\n\ne (4) - 3 = 1 → b\n\nf (5) - 3 = 2 → c\n\ng (6) - 3 = 3 → d\n\nh (7) - 3 = 4 → e\n\ni (8) - 3 = 5 → f\n\nj (9) - 3 = 6 → g\n\nk (10) - 3 = 7 → h\n\nl (11",

Let's consider the modulo approach for clarity.\n\nTo decode, we can use the formula:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - shift) mod 26\n\nwhere a=0, b=1, ..., z=25.\n\nLet's assign numerical values:\n\nl(11) - 6 = 5 → f\n\no(14) - 6 = 8 → i\n\nt(19) - 6 = 13 → n\n\nj(9) - 6 = 3 → d\n\no(14) - 6 = 8 → i\n\nt(19) - 6 = 13 → n\n\nm(12) - 6 = 6 → g\n\nSo \"lotjotm\" decodes to \"findin g\"\n\nWait, m is 12, not 13. So m - 6 = 6 → g is correct.\n\nSecond part: \"vkgik\"\n\nv(21) - 6 = 15 → p\n\nk(10) - 6 = 4 → e\n\ng(6) - 6 = 0 → a\n\ni(8) - 6 = 2 → c\n\nk(10) - 6 = 4 → e\n\nSo \"vkgik\" decodes to \"peace\"\n\nThird part: \"coznot\"\n\nc(2) - 6 = -4 → wrap around: 26 - 4 = 22 → w\n\no(14) - 6 = 8 → i\n\nz(25) - 6 = 19 → t\n\nn(13) - 6 = 7 → h\n\no(14) - 6 = 8 → i\n\nt(19) - 6 = 13 → n\n\nSo \"coznot\" decodes to \"wighton\"\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"finding peace wighton\"\n\nWhich still doesn't make complete sense. Perhaps there was a mistake in the ciphertext or the shift value. Alternatively, maybe the text is divided differently.\n\nLet's try dividing the words differently:\n\n\"lotjot mvg kikco znot\"\n\nDecoding:\n\n\"lotjot\" -> l(11)-6=5=f, o(14)-6=8=i, t(19)-6=13=n, j(9)-6=3=d, o(14)-6=8=i, t(19)-6=13=n → \"findin\"\n\n\"mvg\" -> m(12)-6=6=g, v(21)-6=15=p, g(6)-6=0=a → \"gpa\"\n\n\"kikco\" -> k(10)-6=4=e, i(8)-6=2=c, k(10)-6=4=e, c(2)-6=-4 → wrap to 22=w, o(14)-6=8=i → \"ecewi\"\n\n\"znot\" -> z(25)-6=19=s, n(13)-6=7=h, o(14)-6=8=i, t(19)-6=13=n → \"shin\"\n\nThis seems even less sensible. Maybe the shift is not 6, or there's a typo in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 6 positions forward, not backward.\n\nLet's try shifting forward by 6:\n\n\"Ciphertext: lotjotm vkgik coznot\"\n\n1. l(11) +6=17 → r\n\no(14) +6=20 → u\n\nt(19) +6=25 → z\n\nj(9) +6=15 → o\n\no(14) +6=20 → u\n\nt(19) +6=25 → z\n\nm(12) +6=18 → s\n\n→ \"ruzous\"\n\n2. v(21) +6=27 → b\n\nk(10) +6=16 → q\n\ng(6) +6=12 → m\n\ni(8) +6=14 → n\n\nk(10) +6=16 → q\n\n→ \"bqmnq\"\n\n3. c(2) +6=8 → i\n\no(14) +6=20 → u\n\nz(25) +6=31 → wrap to 5 → f\n\nn(13) +6=19 → t\n\no(14) +6=20 → u\n\nt(19) +6=25 → z\n\n→ \"iutfuz\"\n\nThis also doesn't make sense. Perhaps the shift is indeed 6, but the ciphertext is incorrect or there's a different key.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift varies or there's another type of cipher involved.\n\nGiven the initial instruction, assuming a Caesar cipher with a shift of 6, and following the standard decoding method, the plaintext is:\n\n\"finding peace wighton\"\n\nBut this doesn't form a meaningful sentence, suggesting a possible error in the ciphertext or the shift value.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{meeting peaceighton}} \\]",

Let's check for possible errors.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the shift is positive in the encoding, so decoding should be shifting forward by 6.\n\nLet's try shifting forward by 6:\n\n1. **t** -> t (20) + 6 = 26 -> **z**\n2. **a** -> a (1) + 6 = 7 -> **g**\n3. **x** -> x (24) + 6 = 30 (wrap around: 30 - 26 = 4) -> **d**\n4. **z** -> z (26) + 6 = 32 (wrap around: 32 - 26 = 6) -> **f**\n5. **a** -> a (1) + 6 = 7 -> **g**\n6. **x** -> x (24) + 6 = 30 (wrap around: 30 - 26 = 4) -> **d**\n7. **k** -> k (11) + 6 = 17 -> **r**\n\nSo, \"taxzaxk\" decodes to \"zgdffdr\"\n\n8. **e** -> e (5) + 6 = 11 -> **k**\n9. **u** -> u (21) + 6 = 27 (wrap around: 27 - 26 = 1) -> **a**\n10. **a** -> a (1) + 6 = 7 -> **g**\n11. **x** -> x (24) + 6 = 30 (wrap around: 30 - 26 = 4) -> **d**\n\nSo, \"euax\" decodes to \"kagd\"\n\n12. **x** -> x (24) + 6 = 30 (wrap around: 30 - 26 = 4) -> **d**\n13. **k** -> k (11) + 6 = 17 -> **r**\n14. **r** -> r (18) + 6 = 24 -> **x**\n15. **g** -> g (7) + 6 = 13 -> **m**\n16. **z** -> z (26) + 6 = 32 (wrap around: 32 - 26 = 6) -> **f**\n17. **o** -> o (15) + 6 = 21 -> **u**\n18. **u** -> u (21) + 6 = 27 (wrap around: 27 - 26 = 1) -> **a**\n19. **t** -> t (20) + 6 = 26 -> **z**\n20. **y** -> y (25) + 6 = 31 (wrap around: 31 - 26 = 5) -> **e**\n21. **n** -> n (14) + 6 = 20 -> **t**\n22. **o** -> o (15) + 6 = 21 -> **u**\n23. **v** -> v (22) + 6 = 28 (wrap around: 28 - 26 = 2) -> **b**\n24. **o** -> o (15) + 6 = 21 -> **u**\n25. **y** -> y (25) + 6 = 31 (wrap around: 31 - 26 = 5) -> **e**\n\nSo, \"xkrgzoutynovy\" decodes to \"drxmfauztube\"\n\nCombining all parts:\n\n\"zgdffdr kagd drxmfauztube\"\n\nThis also doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift is not 6, or perhaps the ciphertext has errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 6 positions in the opposite direction. Let's try shifting forward by 6 for decoding.\n\nWait, in Caesar cipher, if the shift was 6 to encode, to decode we need to shift back by 6. But in some conventions, shift might be considered in the encoding direction.\n\nLet's consider the standard definition: in Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. If the shift is 6, encoding shifts letters up by 6 positions, and decoding shifts them back by 6 positions.\n\nGiven that, our first attempt should be correct. But \"ousute zpus selatiposhqis\" doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the shifting.\n\nLet's double-check the shifting for one word.\n\nTake \"taxzaxk\":\n\n- t -> o (20 - 6 = 14)\n- a -> u (1 - 6 = -5 +26=21)\n- x -> s (24 -6=18)\n- z -> t (26 -6=20)\n- a -> u (1 -6=-5 +26=21)\n- x -> s (24 -6=18)\n- k -> e (11 -6=5)\n\nSo \"taxzaxk\" -> \"ousute\"\n\nSimilarly, \"euax\" -> \"zpus\"\n\n- e -> z (5-6=-1 +26=25)\n- u -> p (21-6=15)\n- a -> u (1-6=-5 +26=21)\n- x -> s (24-6=18)\n\nAnd \"xkrgzoutynovy\" -> \"selatiposhqis\"\n\n- x -> s (24-6=18)\n- k -> e (11-6=5)\n- r -> l (18-6=12)\n- g -> a (7-6=1)\n- z -> t (26-6=20)\n- o -> i (15-6=9)\n- u -> p (21-6=15)\n- t -> o (20-6=14)\n- y -> s (25-6=19)\n- n -> h (14-6=",

Let's double-check the decoding for \"mnnmb\":\n\n- m (13) - 9 = 4 → h\n- n (14) - 9 = 5 → e\n- n (14) - 9 = 5 → e\n- m (13) - 9 = 4 → h\n- b (2) - 9: 2 - 9 = -7, wrap around: 26 + (-7) = 19 → s\n\nSo, \"mnnmb\" decodes to \"heehs\". However, \"heehs\" doesn't seem like a meaningful word. Maybe there's a mistake in the decoding process.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n- m -> h\n- n -> e\n- n -> e\n- m -> h\n- b -> s\n\nYes, same result.

Let's check the decoding again:\n\n- k (11) - 9 = 2 → b\n- a (1) - 9: 1 - 9 = -8, wrap around: 26 - 8 = 18 → r\n- r (18) - 9 = 9 → i\n- w (23) - 9 = 14 → n\n- p (16) - 9 = 7 → h\n\nYes, same result.

Perhaps there was a mistake in the shift value or in the decoding process.\n\nLet me try decoding again with a shift of 9.\n\nAlternative approach: instead of subtracting 9, we can add (26 - 9) = 17, since shifting back 9 is equivalent to shifting forward 17 in modulo 26.\n\n1. **First word: \"pxxm\"**\n\n- p (16) + 17 = 33 - 26 = 7 → h\n- x (24) + 17 = 41 - 26 = 15 → o\n- x (24) + 17 = 41 - 26 = 15 → o\n- m (13) + 17 = 30 - 26 = 4 → d\n\nSame as before: \"hood\"\n\n2. **Second word: \"mnnmb\"**\n\n- m (13) + 17 = 30 - 26 = 4 → h\n- n (14) + 17 = 31 - 26 = 5 → e\n- n (14) + 17 = 31 - 26 = 5 → e\n- m (13) + 17 = 30 - 26 = 4 → h\n- b (2) + 17 = 19 → s\n\nAgain, \"heehs\"\n\n3. **Third word: \"karwp\"**\n\n- k (11) + 17 = 28 - 26 = 2 → b\n- a (1) + 17 = 18 → r\n- r (18) + 17 = 35 - 26 = 9 → i\n- w (23) + 17 = 40 - 26 = 14 → n\n- p (16) + 17 = 33 - 26 = 7 → h\n\nSame result: \"brinh\"\n\n4. **Fourth word: \"sxh\"**\n\n- s (19) + 17 = 36 - 26 = 10 → j\n- x (24) + 17 = 41 - 26 = 15 → o\n- h (8) + 17 = 25 → y\n\nSame: \"joy\"\n\nTotal decoded text: \"hood heehs brinh joy\"\n\nThis still doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift is not 9, or there's a mistake in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternative approach: try a different shift value. Perhaps the shift is not 9.\n\nAlternatively, check if the shift is 9 positions back, not forward.\n\nWait, the original instruction says \"shift is 9\", but in Caesar cipher, shift usually means shift forward. So, if it's a shift of 9, to decode, we need to shift back by 9 or equivalently shift forward by 17 (since 26 - 9 = 17).\n\nBut in the first attempt, I subtracted 9, which is shifting back, and got \"hood heehs brinh joy\". Doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 9 instead, to see what happens.\n\n1. **First word: \"pxxm\"**\n\n- p (16) + 9 = 25 → y\n- x (24) + 9 = 33 - 26 = 7 → h\n- x (24) + 9 = 33 - 26 = 7 → h\n- m (13) + 9 = 22 → v\n\nSo, \"pxxm\" becomes \"yhhv\"\n\n2. **Second word: \"mnnmb\"**\n\n- m (13) + 9 = 22 → v\n- n (14) + 9 = 23 → w\n- n (14) + 9 = 23 → w\n- m (13) + 9 = 22 → v\n- b (2) + 9 = 11 → k\n\nSo, \"mnnmb\" becomes \"vwwvk\"\n\n3. **Third word: \"karwp\"**\n\n- k (11) + 9 = 20 → t\n- a (1) + 9 = 10 → j\n- r (18) + 9 = 27 - 26 = 1 → a\n- w (23) + 9 = 32 - 26 = 6 → f\n- p (16) + 9 = 25 → y\n\nSo, \"karwp\" becomes \"tjafy\"\n\n4. **Fourth word: \"sxh\"**\n\n- s (19) + 9 = 28 - 26 = 2 → b\n- x (24) + 9 = 33 - 26 = 7 → h\n- h (8) + 9 = 17 → q\n\nSo, \"sxh\" becomes \"bhq\"\n\nTotal decoded text: \"yhhv vwwvk tjafy bhq\"\n\nThis also doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift is indeed 9, but perhaps the ciphertext is incorrect or there's a different key.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the shift might be 9 positions in a different direction,",

Let's check for possible errors.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the alphabet is case-sensitive, but in Caesar cipher, it's usually case-insensitive. Let's try again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is positive in the encoding, so shifting back by 9 is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the message is \"nurtr eyour relationsh Ips\", but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the wrapping around.\n\nLet's try a different approach: use the formula for decoding: (x - k) mod 26, where x is the position of the letter and k is the shift.\n\nSo, for w (23): (23 - 9) mod 26 = 14 -> N\n\nd (4): (4 - 9) mod 26 = -5 mod 26 = 21 -> U\n\na (1): (1 - 9) mod 26 = -8 mod 26 = 18 -> R\n\nc (3): (3 - 9) mod 26 = -6 mod 26 = 20 -> T\n\nd (4): U\n\na (1): R\n\nn (14): (14 - 9) mod 26 = 5 -> E\n\nSo, first word: N U R T R E\n\nSecond word: h (8): (8 - 9) mod 26 = -1 mod 26 = 25 -> Y\n\nx (24): (24 - 9) mod 26 = 15 -> O\n\nd (4): U\n\na (1): R\n\nSo, second word: Y O U R\n\nThird word: a (1): R\n\nn (14): E\n\nu (21): (21 - 9) mod 26 = 12 -> L\n\nj (10): (10 - 9) mod 26 = 1 -> A\n\nc (3): T\n\nr (18): (18 - 9) mod 26 = 9 -> I\n\nx (24): O\n\nw (23): N\n\nb (2): (2 - 9) mod 26 = -7 mod 26 = 19 -> S\n\nq (17): (17 - 9) mod 26 = 8 -> H\n\nr (18): I\n\ny (25): (25 - 9) mod 26 = 16 -> P\n\nb (2): S\n\nSo, third word: R E L A T I O N S H I P S\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nN U R T R E Y O U R R E L A T I O N S H I P S\n\nWhich can be spaced as:\n\nNurtr, eyour relationsh Ips\n\nStill doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the assumption of the shift direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift was to the left by 9 in encoding, meaning we need to shift right by 9 to decode.\n\nLet's try shifting forward by 9.\n\nw -> x y z a b c d e f -> f\n\nd -> e f g h i j k l m -> m\n\na -> b c d e f g h i j -> j\n\nc -> d e f g h i j k l -> l\n\nd -> m\n\na -> j\n\nn -> o p q r s t u v w -> w\n\nSo, first word: f m j l m w\n\nhxda: h -> p, x -> f, d -> m, a -> j -> p f m j\n\nanujcrxwbqryb: a->j, n->w, u->b, j->w, c->l, r->a, x->f, w->u, b->k, q->b, r->a, y->p, b->k -> j w b w l a f u k b a p k\n\nThat doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 9 positions forward in encoding, so we need to shift back by 9 to decode.\n\nBut in standard Caesar cipher, positive shift means shifting the alphabet forward, so to decode, we shift back by the same amount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 9 positions back in encoding, meaning to decode, we shift forward by 9.\n\nLet's try shifting forward by 9.\n\nw -> shift forward 9: w is 23, 23 + 9 = 32 - 26 = 6 -> F\n\nd -> 4 + 9 = 13 -> M\n\na -> 1 + 9 = 10 -> J\n\nc -> 3 + 9 = 12 -> L\n\nd -> M\n\na -> J\n\nn -> 14 + 9 = 23 -> W\n\nSo, first word: F M J L M W\n\nhxda: h -> 8 + 9 = 17 -> Q\n\nx -> 24 + 9 = 33 -26=7 -> G\n\nd -> M\n\na -> J\n\nanujcrxwbqryb: a->J, n->W, u->B, j->S, c->L, r->A, x->G, w->N, b->K, q->T, r->A, y->H, b->K -> J W B S L A G N K T A H K\n\nStill doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 9 positions in the alphabet, but in the encoding, meaning that each letter is replaced by the letter 9 positions ahead.

For example, U is the 21st letter; 21 - 9 = 12, which is L, not H. There seems to be a mistake in the initial decoding table.\n\n7. **Correct the decoding table:**\n   - A -> N (1 -> 14)\n   - B -> O (2 -> 15)\n   - C -> P (3 -> 16)\n   - D -> Q (4 -> 17)\n   - E -> R (5 -> 18)\n   - F -> S (6 -> 19)\n   - G -> T (7 -> 20)\n   - H -> U (8 -> 21)\n   - I -> V (9 -> 22)\n   - J -> W (10 -> 23)\n   - K -> X (11 -> 24)\n   - L -> Y (12 -> 25)\n   - M -> Z (13 -> 26)\n   - N -> A (14 -> 1)\n   - O -> B (15 -> 2)\n   - P -> C (16 -> 3)\n   - Q -> D (17 -> 4)\n   - R -> E (18 -> 5)\n   - S -> F (19 -> 6)\n   - T -> G (20 -> 7)\n   - U -> H (21 -> 8)\n   - V -> I (22 -> 9)\n   - W -> J (23 -> 10)\n   - X -> K (24 -> 11)\n   - Y -> L (25 -> 12)\n   - Z -> M (26 -> 13)\n\n   Wait, in a Caesar cipher with a shift of 9, to decode, we need to shift back by 9 positions.

The shift is 12.\nuser\nqyndmoq ftq gzwzaiz\nassistant\nTo decode a Caesar cipher with a shift of 12, we need to shift each letter in the ciphertext back by 12 positions in the alphabet. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.\n\nGiven the ciphertext: \"qyndmoq ftq gzwzaiz\"\n\nLet's decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, recall that the alphabet has 26 letters. When shifting back by 12, we can also think of it as shifting forward by 14 positions because 26 - 12 = 14. This is because shifting back by 12 is equivalent to shifting forward by 14 in the alphabet.\n\nHowever, for clarity, I'll stick to shifting back by 12 positions.\n\nLet's create a simple mapping for the alphabet and the shifted positions:\n\nOriginal Alphabet:  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nShifted Alphabet (back by 12): n o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m\n\nNow, we'll decode each letter in the ciphertext \"qyndmoq ftq gzwzaiz\" using this mapping.\n\n1. q -> shift back 12: q is the 17th letter. 17 - 12 = 5 -> e\n\n2. y -> shift back 12: y is the 25th letter. 25 - 12 = 13 -> m\n\n3. n -> shift back 12: n is the 14th letter. 14 - 12 = 2 -> b\n\n4. d -> shift back 12: d is the 4th letter. 4 - 12 = -8. Since we can't have negative positions, we wrap around the alphabet. 26 - 8 = 18 -> r\n\n5. m -> shift back 12: m is the 13th letter. 13 - 12 = 1 -> a\n\n6. o -> shift back 12: o is the 15th letter. 15 - 12 = 3 -> c\n\n7. q -> shift back 12: q is the 17th letter. 17 - 12 = 5 -> e\n\nSo, \"qyndmoq\" decodes to \"embarec\"\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's double-check the decoding for each letter.\n\n1. q -> e (17 - 12 = 5)\n\n2. y -> m (25 - 12 = 13)\n\n3. n -> b (14 - 12 = 2)\n\n4. d -> r (4 - 12 = -8, 26 - 8 = 18)\n\n5. m -> a (13 - 12 = 1)\n\n6. o -> c (15 - 12 = 3)\n\n7. q -> e (17 - 12 = 5)\n\nSo, \"qyndmoq\" should be \"embarec\". But \"embarec\" doesn't seem like a meaningful word. Maybe I made a mistake in the decoding process.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 14 positions instead to see if that makes more sense.\n\nOriginal Alphabet:  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nShifted Alphabet (forward by 14): o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n\n\nWait, that's not correct. Shifting forward by 14 would be:\n\nOriginal: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nShifted: o p q r s t u v w x y z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n\n\nWait, that's a shift of 14 positions forward. But I need to shift back by 12, which is equivalent to shifting forward by 14.\n\nBut earlier, decoding \"qyndmoq\" with shift back 12 gave \"embarec\", which doesn't make sense. Maybe the shift value is incorrect or the ciphertext is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not 12, but -12. Let's check that.\n\nIf the shift is 12, then to decode, we shift back by 12. But if the shift was -12, then to decode, we would shift by -12.\n\nWait, the problem says \"The shift is 12\", but it doesn't specify the direction. In Caesar cipher, a shift of 12 would typically mean shifting the alphabet by 12 positions to the right (positive direction).\n\nBut in decoding, we need to reverse that shift, so shift back by 12 positions to the left.\n\nAlternatively, shifting forward by 14 positions would achieve the same result because 12 positions to the right and 14 positions to the left are equivalent.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 14 positions on the ciphertext \"qyndmoq ftq gzwzaiz\".\n\nTake \"q\":\n\nq is the 17th letter. Shifting forward by 14: 17 + 14 = 31. 31 - 26 = 5 -> e\n\ny is the 25th letter: 25 + 14 = 39, 39 - 26 = 13 -> m\n\nn is the 14th letter: 14 + 14 = 28, 28 - 26 = 2 -> b\n\nd is the 4th letter: 4 + 14 = 18 -> r\n\nm is the 13th letter: 13 + 14 = 27, 27 - 26 = 1 -> a\n\no is the 15th letter: 15 + 14 = 29, 29 - 26 = 3 -> c\n\nq is the 17th letter: 17 + 14 = 31, 31 - 26 = 5 -> e\n\nSo, \"qyndmoq\" becomes \"embarec\"\n\nSimilarly, \"ftq\"：\n\nf: 6 + 14 = 20 -> t\n\nt: 20 + 14 = 34, 34 - 26 = 8 -> h\n\nq: 17 + 14 = 31, 31 - 26 = 5 -> e\n\nSo, \"ftq\" becomes \"the\"\n\nAnd \"gzwzaiz\"：\n\ng: 7 + 14 = 21 -> u\n\nz: 26 + 14 = 40, 40 - 26 = 14 -> n\n\nw: 23 + 14 = 37, 37 - 26 = 11 -> k\n\nz: 26 + 14 = 40, 40 - 26 = 14 -> n\n\na: 1 + 14 = 15 -> o\n\ni: 9 + 14 = 23 -> w\n\nz: 26 + 14 = 40, 40 - 26 = 14 -> n\n\nSo, \"gzwzaiz\" becomes \"unknow\"\n\nWait, \"unknow\" seems like \"unknown\"\n\nBut considering the letters, z -> n, a -> o, i -> w, z -> n\n\nSo, \"gzwzaiz\" -> \"unknow\"\n\nBut \"unknown\" would be more appropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\"embarec the unknown\"\n\nBut \"embarec\" doesn't make sense. Maybe there's an error in the decoding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not 12, but -12.

When shifting back by 12, we can also think of it as shifting forward by 14 positions (since 26 - 12 = 14). However, for consistency, we'll stick to shifting back by 12.\n\nWe'll create a function to decode each letter:\n\n- For any letter, subtract 12 positions from its position in the alphabet.\n\n- If the result is less than 'a' (97 in ASCII), wrap around by adding 26.\n\nHere's the decoding process for each character in the ciphertext:\n\n1. \"f\" (102) - 12 = 90, which is \"Z\" (but since we're dealing with lowercase, it should be \"z\").

The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.\n\nGiven the ciphertext: \"nqxuqhq uz ftq rgfgdq\"\n\nLet's decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, recall that the alphabet has 26 letters. When shifting back by 12, we can also think of it as shifting forward by 14 positions because 26 - 12 = 14. This is because shifting back by 12 is equivalent to shifting forward by 14 in the alphabet.\n\nHowever, for clarity, I'll stick to shifting back by 12 positions.\n\nLet's create a simple mapping for the alphabet with a shift of 12:\n\nOriginal alphabet: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\nShifted alphabet: cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab\n\nWait, actually, for decoding, we need to map each letter in the ciphertext back by 12 positions.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- 'n' shifted back by 12 positions:\n\nn is the 14th letter (a=1, b=2, ..., n=14).\n\n14 - 12 = 2, which is 'b'.\n\n- 'q' shifted back by 12 positions:\n\nq is the 17th letter.\n\n17 - 12 = 5, which is 'e'.\n\n- And so on.\n\nTo make this efficient, we can create a function or a table to map each letter to its decoded counterpart.\n\nBut for this example, I'll decode it letter by letter.\n\nCiphertext: n q x u q h q u z f t q r g f g d q\n\nLet's decode each letter:\n\nn -> b\n\nq -> e\n\nx -> v\n\nu -> m\n\nq -> e\n\nh -> f\n\nq -> e\n\nu -> m\n\nz -> r\n\nf -> d\n\nt -> r\n\nq -> e\n\nr -> l\n\ng -> a\n\nf -> d\n\ng -> a\n\nd -> b\n\nq -> e\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nb e v m e f e m r d r e l a d a b e\n\nNow, let's add spaces to make sense of the decoded text:\n\n\"b e v m e f e m r d r e l a d a b e\"\n\nThis seems like a sequence of letters without spaces. Let's try to group them into words.\n\nLooking at the original ciphertext: \"nqxuqhq uz ftq rgfgdq\"\n\nIt has spaces after \"nqxuqhq\", \"uz\", \"ftq\", and \"rgfgdq\".\n\nSo, let's decode each part separately:\n\n1. \"nqxuqhq\" -> \"b e v m e f e\"\n\n2. \"uz\" -> \"r d\"\n\n3. \"ftq\" -> \"r e l\"\n\n4. \"rgfgdq\" -> \"a d a b e\"\n\nNow, combining them with spaces:\n\n\"b e v m e f e r d r e l a d a b e\"\n\nBut this still doesn't make much sense. Maybe the spaces were not correctly placed, or perhaps the shift is different.\n\nWait, the user specified a shift of 12, so let's double-check the decoding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ciphertext was not divided correctly into words.\n\nLet's try to decode the entire ciphertext without dividing into parts:\n\nCiphertext: n q x u q h q u z f t q r g f g d q\n\nDecoded: b e v m e f e m r d r e l a d a b e\n\nLooking at this, perhaps it's meant to be read as:\n\n\"b e v m e f e m r d r e l a d a b e\"\n\nWhich could be:\n\n\"b e v m e f e m r d r e l a d a b e\"\n\nThis still doesn't form meaningful words. Maybe the shift is different, or there's a mistake in the decoding process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 12 positions forward instead of backward.\n\nLet's try shifting forward by 12 positions.\n\nOriginal alphabet: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n\nShift forward by 12:\n\nn -> b (n is 14, +12 = 26, which is z, but since we wrap around, 26 - 26 = 0, which is a, but in reality, n +12 should be x)\n\nWait, actually, to shift forward by 12:\n\na -> m\n\nb -> n\n\nc -> o\n\n...\n\nn -> x\n\nq -> a\n\nWait, q is 17, +12 = 29 - 26 = 3, which is c.\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent with the initial assumption.\n\nBut the user specified a shift of 12, and in Caesar cipher, a shift of 12 means each letter is replaced by the letter 12 positions ahead in the alphabet.\n\nSo, to decode, we need to shift back by 12 positions.\n\nBut perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLet's try another approach.\n\nLet's consider that the shift is 12 positions forward for encoding, so decoding would be 12 positions backward.\n\nBut as per standard Caesar cipher, a shift of 12 means each letter is replaced by the letter 12 positions ahead.\n\nTo decode, we need to shift back by 12 positions.\n\nAlternatively, since shifting forward by 12 and then shifting backward by 12 brings us back to the original.\n\nBut in practice, if the ciphertext was encoded with a shift of 12 forward, decoding requires shifting backward by 12.\n\nAlternatively, shifting forward by 14 is equivalent to shifting backward by 12, since 12 and 14 are additive inverses modulo 26 (12 + 14 = 26 ≡ 0 mod 26).\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let's stick to shifting backward by 12.\n\nGiven that, let's try decoding again.\n\nCiphertext: n q x u q h q u z f t q r g f g d q\n\nDecoding each letter by shifting back 12 positions:\n\nn -> b\n\nq -> e\n\nx -> v\n\nu -> m\n\nq -> e\n\nh -> f\n\nq -> e\n\nu -> m\n\nz -> r\n\nf -> d\n\nt -> r\n\nq -> e\n\nr -> l\n\ng -> a\n\nf -> d\n\ng -> a\n\nd -> b\n\nq -> e\n\nSo, the decoded text is: \"b e v m e f e m r d r e l a d a b e\"\n\nThis still doesn't make sense.

Let's decode the given text step by step.\n\nCiphertext: `otmzsq ue ftq azxk oazefmzf`\n\nFirst, let's list the alphabet for reference:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nSince the shift is 12, we'll subtract 12 from the position of each letter in the alphabet to get the original letter.\n\nLet's decode each letter one by one:\n\n1. o (15th letter): 15 - 12 = 3 → C\n2. t (20th letter): 20 - 12 = 8 → H\n3. m (13th letter): 13 - 12 = 1 → A\n4. z (26th letter): 26 - 12 = 14 → N\n5. s (19th letter): 19 - 12 = 7 → G\n6. q (17th letter): 17 - 12 = 5 → E\n\nSo, `otmzsq` decodes to `CHANG_E`\n\n7. u (21st letter): 21 - 12 = 9 → I\n8. e (5th letter): 5 - 12 = -7 → Since it's negative, we wrap around the alphabet. 26 - 7 = 19 → S\n\nSo, `ue` decodes to `IS`\n\n9. f (6th letter): 6 - 12 = -6 → 26 - 6 = 20 → T\n10. t (20th letter): 20 - 12 = 8 → H\n11. q (17th letter): 17 - 12 = 5 → E\n\nSo, `ftq` decodes to `THE`\n\n12. a (1st letter): 1 - 12 = -11 → 26 - 11 = 15 → O\n13. z (26th letter): 26 - 12 = 14 → N\n14. x (24th letter): 24 - 12 = 12 → L\n15. k (11th letter): 11 - 12 = -1 → 26 - 1 = 25 → Y\n\nSo, `azxk` decodes to `ONLY`\n\n16. o (15th letter): 15 - 12 = 3 → C\n17. a (1st letter): 1 - 12 = -11 → 26 - 11 = 15 → O\n18. z (26th letter): 26 - 12 = 14 → N\n19. e (5th letter): 5 - 12 = -7 → 26 - 7 = 19 → T\n20. f (6th letter): 6 - 12 = -6 → 26 - 6 = 20 → T\n21. m (13th letter): 13 - 12 = 1 → A\n22. z (26th letter): 26 - 12 = 14 → N\n23. f (6th letter): 6 - 12 = -6 → 26 - 6 = 20 → T\n\nSo, `oazefmzf` decodes to `CONTAIN_T`\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCHANG_E IS THE ONLY CONTAIN_T\n\nAssuming that \"CHANG_E\" should be \"CHANGE\" and \"CONTAIN_T\" should be \"CONTAIN\", the decoded message is:\n\n\"CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONTAIN\"\n\nHowever, \"CONTAIN\" doesn't make much sense in this context. It's possible there's a typo in the original ciphertext or in the decoding process. Let's double-check the last word:\n\no (15) -12 = 3 → C\n\na (1) -12 = 15 → O\n\nz (26) -12 = 14 → N\n\ne (5) -12 = 19 → S\n\nf (6) -12 = 20 → T\n\nm (13) -12 = 1 → A\n\nz (26) -12 = 14 → N\n\nf (6) -12 = 20 → T\n\nSo, `oazefmzf` decodes to `COSTANT`, which still doesn't make sense. Maybe the original text had a different meaning or there's an error in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that \"CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONTAIN_T\" might be intended to be \"CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT\", then perhaps the last word should be \"CONSTANT\". Let's check if that's possible:\n\nIf we assume that the last word is \"CONSTANT\", then the ciphertext should correspond to:\n\nC (3+12=15) → o\n\nO (15+12=27-26=1) → a\n\nN (14+12=26) → z\n\nS (19+12=31-26=5) → e\n\nT (20+12=32-26=6) → f\n\nA (1+12=13) → m\n\nN (14+12=26) → z\n\nT (20+12=32-26=6) → f\n\nSo, \"CONSTANT\" would encode to `oazefmzf`, which matches the original ciphertext. Therefore, the correct decoding is:\n\n\"CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT}} \\]",
