Let's double-check:\n\n- j shifted back by 3 is g, but in \"finding\", it should be n. Maybe there's a typo in the ciphertext or in my decoding.\n\nActually, \"j\" is the 10th letter:\n- 10 - 3 = 7 → g\n\nBut in \"finding\", the last letter is n, which is the 14th letter. Maybe the ciphertext is \"ilqglqj\" but it should be \"ilqglqn\" for \"finding\". But let's proceed with the given ciphertext.\n\nNext, space:\n\n- Space remains space.\n\nThen \"shdfh\":\n\n1. **s**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - s is the 19th letter.\n   - 19 - 3 = 16 → p\n\n2. **h**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - h is the 8th letter.\n   - 8 - 3 = 5 → e\n\n3. **d**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - d is the 4th letter.\n   - 4 - 3 = 1 → a\n\n4. **f**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - f is the 6th letter.\n   - 6 - 3 = 3 → c\n\n5. **h**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - h is the 8th letter.\n   - 8 - 3 = 5 → e\n\nSo, \"shdfh\" decodes to \"peace\".\n\nLastly, \"zlwklq\":\n\n1. **z**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - z is the 26th letter.\n   - 26 - 3 = 23 → w\n\n2. **l**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - l is the 12th letter.\n   - 12 - 3 = 9 → i\n\n3. **w**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - w is the 23rd letter.\n   - 23 - 3 = 20 → t\n\n4. **k**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - k is the 11th letter.\n   - 11 - 3 = 8 → h\n\n5. **l**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - l is the 12th letter.\n   - 12 - 3 = 9 → i\n\n6. **q**: Shift back by 3 positions.\n   - q is the 17th letter.\n   - 17 - 3 = 14 → n\n\nSo, \"zlwklq\" decodes to \"withe n\".

So perhaps the ciphertext is incorrect, or maybe the shift is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 3 positions forward, not backward.\n\nLet's try shifting forward by 3 positions:\n\n1. **i**: 9 + 3 = 12 → l\n\n2. **l**: 12 + 3 = 15 → o\n\n3. **q**: 17 + 3 = 20 → t\n\n4. **g**: 7 + 3 = 10 → j\n\n5. **l**: 12 + 3 = 15 → o\n\n6. **q**: 17 + 3 = 20 → t\n\n7. **j**: 10 + 3 = 13 → m\n\nSo, \"ilqglqj\" becomes \"lototm\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"decode the following Caesar cipher text. The shift is 3.\" Decoding typically means reversing the encryption, so shifting back by the same amount.\n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, \"decode\" might mean to apply the shift as is, which could be forward or backward depending on the convention.\n\nGiven that shifting back by 3 positions from \"ilqglqj\" gives \"finding\", which is a meaningful word, but the last letter doesn't match, perhaps there's a typo in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is different.

Let's decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the alphabet for reference:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nNow, since the shift is 3, I'll create a shifted alphabet to see the mapping:\n\nOriginal: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nShifted: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C\n\nSo, each letter in the ciphertext corresponds to the letter three positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nLet's decode each word one by one.\n\nFirst word: fkhulvk\n\nf -> c (f is 6th letter, c is 3rd)\n\nk -> h (k is 11th, h is 8th)\n\nh -> e (h is 8th, e is 5th)\n\nu -> r (u is 21st, r is 18th)\n\nl -> i (l is 12th, i is 9th)\n\nv -> s (v is 22nd, s is 19th)\n\nk -> h (k is 11th, h is 8th)\n\nSo, fkhulvk decodes to \"cheries\"\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's check again.\n\nf -> c\n\nk -> h\n\nh -> e\n\nu -> r\n\nl -> i\n\nv -> s\n\nk -> h\n\nSo, \"cheries\" seems correct, but it doesn't make much sense in this context. Maybe I should check if there's a typo in the ciphertext.\n\nSecond word: wkh\n\nw -> t (w is 23rd, t is 20th)\n\nk -> h\n\nh -> e\n\nSo, wkh decodes to \"the\"\n\nThird word: olwwoh\n\no -> l\n\nl -> i\n\nw -> t\n\nw -> t\n\no -> l\n\nh -> e\n\nSo, olwwoh decodes to \"little\"\n\nWait, \"litlle\" seems like a misspelling of \"little\".\n\nFourth word: prphqwv\n\np -> m\n\nr -> o\n\np -> m\n\nh -> e\n\nq -> n\n\nw -> t\n\nv -> s\n\nSo, prphqwv decodes to \"moemen ts\"\n\nWait, \"moemen ts\" doesn't make sense. Let's check each letter again.\n\np -> m\n\nr -> o\n\np -> m\n\nh -> e\n\nq -> n\n\nw -> t\n\nv -> s\n\nSo, prphqwv is \"moemnts\", which seems like a misspelling of \"moments\".\n\nOverall, the decoded message seems to be:\n\n\"cheries the little moments\"\n\nBut this doesn't make much sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the ciphertext or in the decoding process.\n\nLet me try decoding again, more carefully.\n\nFirst word: fkhulvk\n\nf -> c\n\nk -> h\n\nh -> e\n\nu -> r\n\nl -> i\n\nv -> s\n\nk -> h\n\n\"cheries\"\n\nSecond word: wkh\n\nw -> t\n\nk -> h\n\nh -> e\n\n\"the\"\n\nThird word: olwwoh\n\no -> l\n\nl -> i\n\nw -> t\n\nw -> t\n\no -> l\n\nh -> e\n\n\"little\"\n\nFourth word: prphqwv\n\np -> m\n\nr -> o\n\np -> m\n\nh -> e\n\nq -> n\n\nw -> t\n\nv -> s\n\n\"moemnts\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is \"prphqwv\" is actually \"prphq-wv\", but that doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift isn't 3.

But if the shift was forward by 3 in encryption, then shifting back by 3 should decode it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift was to the left, meaning the shift was -3. In that case, shifting back by 3 would be incorrect. Let's explore that.\n\nIf the shift was to the left by 3 positions, meaning each letter was replaced by the letter 3 positions before it, then to decode, I would need to shift back to the right by 3 positions.\n\nBut according to the standard Caesar cipher, a shift of 3 means shifting to the right by 3 positions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion in the direction of the shift.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIn a Caesar cipher, a positive shift value means shifting the alphabet to the right. For example, with a shift of 3:\n\nA -> D\n\nB -> E\n\nC -> F\n\nand so on.\n\nTo decode, we shift back to the left by the same number of positions.\n\nSo, in this case, shifting back by 3 positions should work.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the ciphertext or in the assumed shift value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is not 3, but the problem states that the shift is 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text is not entirely in lowercase, or there are punctuation marks.\n\nBut given the information, I'll proceed with shifting each letter back by 3 positions.\n\nSo, dssuhfldwh wkh vpdoo wklqjv decodes to appercte the small thigns.\n\nWhich is close to \"appeal the small things\", but with some discrepancies.\n\nPerhaps the original ciphertext has typos, or perhaps the shift is different.\n\nBut as per the instruction, the shift is 3, so I'll go with this decoding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{appeal the small things}} \\]",

If the result is less than 1, we wrap around to the end of the alphabet.\n\nSo, for B (2nd letter):\n2 - 3 = -1 → wrap around: 26 + (-1) = 25 → Y\n\nActually, that's correct.

The ciphertext provided is \"zaxtotm ubkx g tkc rkgl\". Let's decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, since the shift is 6, we'll be shifting back by 6 positions to get the original plaintext.\n\nWe'll handle each character in the ciphertext one by one, ignoring any non-alphabetic characters (like spaces) since they don't change.\n\nLet's start with the first word: \"zaxtotm\"\n\n1. z -> shift back by 6: z is the 26th letter. 26 - 6 = 20, which is t.\n\n2. a -> a is the 1st letter. 1 - 6 = -5. Since we can't have negative positions, we wrap around the alphabet. 26 - 5 = 21, which is u.\n\n3. x -> x is the 24th letter. 24 - 6 = 18, which is s.\n\n4. t -> t is the 20th letter. 20 - 6 = 14, which is n.\n\n5. o -> o is the 15th letter. 15 - 6 = 9, which is i.\n\n6. t -> again, t is the 20th letter. 20 - 6 = 14, which is n.\n\n7. m -> m is the 13th letter. 13 - 6 = 7, which is g.\n\nSo, \"zaxtotm\" decodes to \"tusning\".\n\nNext, \"ubkx\"\n\n1. u -> u is the 21st letter. 21 - 6 = 15, which is o.\n\n2. b -> b is the 2nd letter. 2 - 6 = -4. Wrap around: 26 - 4 = 22, which is v.\n\n3. k -> k is the 11th letter. 11 - 6 = 5, which is e.\n\n4. x -> x is the 24th letter. 24 - 6 = 18, which is r.\n\nSo, \"ubkx\" decodes to \"over\".\n\nNext, \"g\"\n\n1. g is the 7th letter. 7 - 6 = 1, which is a.\n\nSo, \"g\" decodes to \"a\".\n\nFinally, \"tkc rkgl\"\n\nFirst, \"tkc\"\n\n1. t -> 20 - 6 = 14, which is n.\n\n2. k -> 11 - 6 = 5, which is e.\n\n3. c -> 3 - 6 = -3. Wrap around: 26 - 3 = 23, which is w.\n\nSo, \"tkc\" decodes to \"new\".\n\nNext, \"rkgl\"\n\n1. r -> 18 - 6 = 12, which is l.\n\n2. k -> 11 - 6 = 5, which is e.\n\n3. g -> 7 - 6 = 1, which is a.\n\n4. l -> 12 - 6 = 6, which is f.\n\nSo, \"rkgl\" decodes to \"leaf\".\n\nPutting it all together, the decoded plaintext is: \"tusning over a new leaf\"\n\nHowever, this seems a bit off because \"tusning\" doesn't look like a proper English word. Let's double-check the decoding for \"zaxtotm\".\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the wrapping around for the letters that go below 1. Let's re-examine \"a\" in \"zaxtotm\".\n\na is the 1st letter. 1 - 6 = -5. To wrap around, we add 26: 26 - 5 = 21, which is u. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, b is 2. 2 - 6 = -4. 26 - 4 = 22, which is v. Correct.\n\nBut \"tusning\" doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the shifting.\n\nLet me try shifting each letter back by 6 positions again.\n\nStarting with \"zaxtotm\":\n\n- z: 26 - 6 = 20 → t\n\n- a: 1 - 6 = -5 → 26 - 5 = 21 → u\n\n- x: 24 - 6 = 18 → s\n\n- t: 20 - 6 = 14 → n\n\n- o: 15 - 6 = 9 → i\n\n- t: 20 - 6 = 14 → n\n\n- m: 13 - 6 = 7 → g\n\nSo, \"zaxtotm\" → \"tusning\"\n\n\"hmm, maybe it's a typing error or something. Let's proceed with the rest.\n\n\"ubkx\" → \"over\"\n\n\"g\" → \"a\"\n\n\"tkc\" → \"new\"\n\n\"rkgl\" → \"leaf\"\n\nSo, \"tusning over a new leaf\"\n\nThis seems like a phrase, but \"tusning\" is not a standard English word. Maybe it's a typo or a specific term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not 6, but let's assume the shift is indeed 6 as given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original text has some context that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the word is \"tuning\" instead of \"tusning\". Maybe there was a mistake in the shifting.\n\nLet me check \"zaxtotm\" again.\n\n- z: 26 - 6 = 20 → t\n\n- a: 1 - 6 = -5 → 26 - 5 = 21 → u\n\n- x: 24 - 6 = 18 → s\n\n- t: 20 - 6 = 14 → n\n\n- o: 15 - 6 = 9 → i\n\n- t: 20 - 6 = 14 → n\n\n- m: 13 - 6 = 7 → g\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, \"tusning\" is the correct decoding for \"zaxtotm\" with a shift of 6.\n\nPerhaps \"tusning\" is a typo and it should be \"tuning\", which would make sense in the context of \"tuning over a new leaf\", meaning starting anew or changing one's ways.\n\nAlternatively, \"tusning\" might be a word in another language, but since the instruction is to decode to English, it's likely a typo.\n\nIn any case, based on the given ciphertext and the shift of 6, the decoded plaintext is \"tusning over a new leaf\".\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{tusning over a new leaf}} \\]",

The alphabet is:\n\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\nWith a shift of 6, each letter is moved back by 6 positions.

Let's take the ciphertext \"ingtmk oy znk utre iutyzgtz\" and decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the alphabet for reference:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nNow, since the shift is 6, I'll create a shifted alphabet to see the mapping:\n\nOriginal: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nShifted: G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F\n\nSo, each letter in the ciphertext corresponds to the letter 6 positions before it in the alphabet.\n\nLet's decode each word one by one.\n\nFirst word: \"ingtmk\"\n\nI -> M (I is 9th letter, minus 6 is 3rd letter: C)\n\nN -> R (14 - 6 = 8: H)\n\nG -> A (7 - 6 = 1: A)\n\nT -> N (20 - 6 = 14: N)\n\nM -> G (13 - 6 = 7: G)\n\nK -> E (11 - 6 = 5: E)\n\nSo, \"ingtmk\" decodes to \"charng\"\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check again.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in the mapping. Let's try again.\n\nI is the 9th letter. Subtract 6: 9 - 6 = 3, which is C.\n\nN is 14th: 14 - 6 = 8, H.\n\nG is 7th: 7 - 6 = 1, A.\n\nT is 20th: 20 - 6 = 14, N.\n\nM is 13th: 13 - 6 = 7, G.\n\nK is 11th: 11 - 6 = 5, E.\n\nSo, \"ingtmk\" decodes to \"charng\", but \"charng\" doesn't seem like a real word. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the wrap-around. If I go past A, I wrap around to Z.\n\nWait, no, since I'm shifting back, I don't need to worry about wrap-around in the same way.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's use the formula:\n\nplaintext letter = (ciphertext letter - shift) mod 26\n\nSo, for I (9): (9 - 6) mod 26 = 3 mod 26 = 3 → C\n\nN (14): (14 - 6) mod 26 = 8 mod 26 = 8 → H\n\nG (7): (7 - 6) mod 26 = 1 mod 26 = 1 → A\n\nT (20): (20 - 6) mod 26 = 14 mod 26 = 14 → N\n\nM (13): (13 - 6) mod 26 = 7 mod 26 = 7 → G\n\nK (11): (11 - 6) mod 26 = 5 mod 26 = 5 → E\n\nSo, again, \"charng\".

Maybe a typo in the ciphertext.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"charng is the only contast\"\n\nBut \"charng\" doesn't make sense. Maybe there's an error in the ciphertext or the shift value. Alternatively, perhaps the text is not entirely in English or has typos.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first word is \"changing\" instead of \"charng\". Let me check the ciphertext again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misidentified the letters. Let's double-check the first word \"ingtmk\".\n\nI -> C\n\nN -> H\n\nG -> A\n\nT -> N\n\nM -> G\n\nK -> E\n\nSo, \"chingae\"? Still doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is different. But the instruction says the shift is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text is in a different language or code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 6 positions forward, not backward. Let's try that.\n\nSo, for a Caesar cipher, shifting forward by 6:\n\nOriginal: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nShifted: G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E F\n\nSo, to decode, I need to shift back by 6.\n\nWait, but if the shift is 6, and it's a Caesar cipher, it's a shift cipher, so shifting back by 6 should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 6 positions backward, meaning the cipher shifts forward by 6.\n\nWait, need to clarify.\n\nIn a Caesar cipher, the cipher text is produced by shifting the plaintext letters by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.\n\nSo, if the shift is 6, to encode, you shift each letter forward by 6 positions.\n\nTo decode, you shift each letter backward by 6 positions.\n\nSo, my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 6 positions backward, meaning that the cipher text was created by shifting the plaintext backward by 6 positions.\n\nIn that case, to decode, I would need to shift the cipher text forward by 6 positions.\n\nBut the instruction says \"the shift is 6\", without specifying direction.\n\nPerhaps it's a shift of 6 positions forward in encoding, so decoding is shifting backward by 6.\n\nBut in the instruction, it says \"the shift is 6\", and \"decode the following Caesar cipher text\", so I think shifting backward by 6 is correct.\n\nGiven that, and given that \"ingtmk\" decodes to \"charng\", which doesn't make sense, perhaps there's a mistake in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text is not entirely letters, or there are some errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 6 positions, but wrapping around the alphabet correctly.\n\nLet me try decoding \"ingtmk\" again:\n\nI -> C\n\nN -> H\n\nG -> A\n\nT -> N\n\nM -> G\n\nK -> E\n\nSo, \"charng\"\n\nStill doesn't",

Maybe I made a mistake in counting the shifts.\n\nLet me double-check the shifts:\n\n1. n -> e (n -> m -> l -> k -> j -> i -> h -> g -> f -> e)\n   n to m is 1, m to l is 2, l to k is 3, k to j is 4, j to i is 5, i to h is 6, h to g is 7, g to f is 8, f to e is 9.\n\n2. v -> m (v -> u -> t -> s -> r -> q -> p -> o -> n -> m)\n\n3. k -> b\n\n4. a -> r\n\n5. j -> a\n\n6. l -> c\n\n7. n -> e\n\nSo, \"nvkajln\" decodes to \"embare\". Wait, no, according to this, it's \"e m b a r c e\". Hmm, that still doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the counting.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nn -> e (n to m is 1, m to l is 2, l to k is 3, k to j is 4, j to i is 5, i to h is 6, h to g is 7, g to f is 8, f to e is 9)\n\nv -> m (v to u is 1, u to t is 2, t to s is 3, s to r is 4, r to q is 5, q to p is 6, p to o is 7, o to n is 8, n to m is 9)\n\nk -> b (k to j is 1, j to i is 2, i to h is 3, h to g is 4, g to f is 5, f to e is 6, e to d is 7, d to c is 8, c to b is 9)\n\na -> r (a to z is 1, z to y is 2, y to x is 3, x to w is 4, w to v is 5, v to u is 6, u to t is 7, t to s is 8, s to r is 9)\n\nj -> a (j to i is 1, i to h is 2, h to g is 3, g to f is 4, f to e is 5, e to d is 6, d to c is 7, c to b is 8, b to a is 9)\n\nl -> c (l to k is 1, k to j is 2, j to i is 3, i to h is 4, h to g is 5, g to f is 6, f to e is 7, e to d is 8, d to c is 9)\n\nn -> e (same as first letter)\n\nSo, \"nvkajln\" decodes to \"embare\". Wait, no, letter by letter:\n\nn -> e\n\nv -> m\n\nk -> b\n\na -> r\n\nj -> a\n\nl -> c\n\nn -> e\n\nSo, \"embare\". But that doesn't seem right. Maybe the word is \"embark\", but according to this, it's \"embare\". Perhaps I need to check if there's a mistake in the shift count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift isn't 9. But the prompt says the shift is 9, so I have to stick with that.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the alphabet wraps around. Wait, I think I need to consider the alphabet as a circular list.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll use the modulo operation to handle the wrap-around.\n\nThe formula to decode a Caesar cipher is:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - shift) mod 26\n\nWhere A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25.\n\nSo, let's assign each letter a number:\n\nn -> 13\n\nv -> 21\n\nk -> 10\n\na -> 0\n\nj -> 9\n\nl -> 11\n\nn -> 13\n\nc -> 2\n\nq -> 16\n\nn -> 10\n\nd -> 3\n\nw -> 22\n\nt -> 19\n\nw -> 22\n\nx -> 23\n\nf -> 5\n\nw -> 22\n\nNow, subtract the shift (9) and take modulo 26:\n\nFor \"nvkajln\":\n\nn: (13 - 9) mod 26 = 4 -> e\n\nv: (21 - 9) mod 26 = 12 -> m\n\nk: (10 - 9) mod 26 = 1 -> b\n\na: (0 - 9) mod 26 = -9 mod 26 = 17 -> r\n\nj: (9 - 9) mod 26 = 0 -> a\n\nl: (11 - 9) mod 26 = 2 -> c\n\nn: (13 - 9) mod 26 = 4 -> e\n\nSo, \"embare\" again. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe the word is \"embark\", but with an 'e' at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the last letter should be different. Let me check the ciphertext again. Oh, wait, the first group is \"nvkajln\", then a space, then \"cqn\", another space, then \"dwtwxfw\".\n\nSo, \"nvkajln cqn dwtwxfw\"\n\nDecoding \"cqn\":\n\nc: (2 - 9) mod 26 = -7 mod 26 = 19 -> t\n\nq: (16 - 9) mod 26 = 7 -> h\n\nn: (13 - 9) mod 26 = 4 -> e\n\nSo, \"the\"\n\nThen, \"dwtwxfw\":\n\nd: (3 - 9) mod 26 = -6 mod 26 = 20 -> u\n\nw: (22 - 9) mod 26 = 13 -> n\n\nt: (19 - 9) mod 26 = 10 -> k\n\nw: (22 - 9) mod 26 = 13 -> n\n\nx: (23 - 9) mod 26 = 14 -> o\n\nf: (5 - 9) mod 26 = -4 mod 26 = 22 -> w\n\nw: (22 - 9) mod 26 = 13 -> n\n\nSo, \"unknow n\"\n\nWait, that seems like \"unknown\", but with an extra 'n' at the end.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"embare the unknown\"\n\nBut \"",

The ciphertext provided is \"unjawrwp oaxv vrbcjtnb\". I'll decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, since the shift is 9, I'll be shifting back by 9 positions to get the original plaintext.\n\nI should also consider that the alphabet wraps around, so if I go past 'a' while shifting back, I'll loop back to 'z'. Also, I need to handle spaces and non-alphabetic characters appropriately; they should remain unchanged.\n\nLet's start decoding each character in the ciphertext:\n\n1. 'u' - 9 positions back: u -> s -> r -> q -> p -> o -> n -> m -> l -> k. So, 'u' becomes 'k'.\n\n2. 'n' - 9 positions back: n -> m -> l -> k -> j -> i -> h -> g -> f -> e. So, 'n' becomes 'e'.\n\n3. 'j' - 9 positions back: j -> i -> h -> g -> f -> e -> d -> c -> b -> a. So, 'j' becomes 'a'.\n\n4. 'a' - 9 positions back: Since 'a' is the first letter, shifting back wraps around the alphabet. a -> z -> y -> x -> w -> v -> u -> t -> s -> r. So, 'a' becomes 'r'.\n\n5. 'w' - 9 positions back: w -> v -> u -> t -> s -> r -> q -> p -> o -> n. So, 'w' becomes 'n'.\n\n6. 'r' - 9 positions back: r -> q -> p -> o -> n -> m -> l -> k -> j -> i. So, 'r' becomes 'i'.\n\n7. 'w' - same as above, 'w' becomes 'n'.\n\n8. 'p' - 9 positions back: p -> o -> n -> m -> l -> k -> j -> i -> h -> g. So, 'p' becomes 'g'.\n\nNow, moving to the next word:\n\n9.

Let's correct that.\n\nActually, to shift back 9 positions, I can use the formula:\n\nplaintext = (ciphertext - shift) mod 26\n\nwhere each letter is assigned a number from 0 to 25 (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25).\n\nSo, let's assign numerical values and compute accordingly to avoid errors.\n\nFirst, create a mapping of letters to their numerical values:\n\na:0, b:1, c:2, d:3, e:4, f:5, g:6, h:7, i:8, j:9, k:10, l:11, m:12, n:13, o:14, p:15, q:16, r:17, s:18, t:19, u:20, v:21, w:22, x:23, y:24, z:25\n\nNow, for each letter in the ciphertext, subtract 9 and take mod 26 to get the plaintext letter.\n\nLet's apply this to each letter:\n\n1. 'u' : 20 - 9 = 11 → l\n\n2. 'n' : 13 - 9 = 4 → e\n\n3. 'j' : 9 - 9 = 0 → a\n\n4. 'a' : 0 - 9 = -9 mod 26 = 17 → r\n\n5. 'w' : 22 - 9 = 13 → n\n\n6. 'r' : 17 - 9 = 8 → i\n\n7.

'v' : 21 - 9 = 12 → m\n\nSpace remains space.\n\n13. 'v' : 21 - 9 = 12 → m\n\n14. 'r' : 17 - 9 = 8 → i\n\n15. 'b' : 1 - 9 = -8 mod 26 = 18 → s\n\n16. 'c' : 2 - 9 = -7 mod 26 = 19 → t\n\n17.

The standard English alphabet is:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nShifting back by 12 positions means that:\n\nA -> Q\n\nB -> R\n\nC -> S\n\nD -> T\n\nE -> U\n\nF -> V\n\nG -> W\n\nH -> X\n\nI -> Y\n\nJ -> Z\n\nK -> A\n\nL -> B\n\nM -> C\n\nN -> D\n\nO -> E\n\nP -> F\n\nQ -> G\n\nR -> H\n\nS -> I\n\nT -> J\n\nU -> K\n\nV -> L\n\nW -> M\n\nX -> N\n\nY -> O\n\nZ -> P\n\nSo, I can create a decoding table where each ciphertext letter maps to the corresponding plaintext letter.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the ciphertext \"ruzpuzs bqmoq iuftuz\".\n\nStarting with \"r\":\n\nR -> H\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O\n\nP -> N\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O\n\nS -> I\n\nSo, \"ruzpuzs\" decodes to \"hknkoi\".\n\nNext, \"bqmoq\":\n\nB -> J\n\nQ -> G\n\nM -> C\n\nO -> E\n\nQ -> G\n\nSo, \"bqmoq\" decodes to \"jgcge\".\n\nFinally, \"iuftuz\":\n\nI -> Y\n\nF -> L\n\nU -> K\n\nT -> J\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O\n\nSo, \"iuftuz\" decodes to \"y lkjo\".\n\nWait a minute, there seems to be a space missing or misinterpreted. Let me check the original ciphertext again: \"ruzpuzs bqmoq iuftuz\". It appears that \"i\" is separated from \"uftuz\", but in the decoding, I need to ensure that spaces are correctly placed in the plaintext.\n\nLet me re-examine the decoding:\n\n\"ruzpuzs\" -> \"hknkoi\"\n\n\"bqmoq\" -> \"jgcge\"\n\n\"i\" -> \"y\"\n\n\"uftuz\" -> \"lkjo\"\n\nSo, putting it all together: \"hknkoi jgcge y lkjo\".\n\nBut this doesn't seem to make much sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the decoding process. Let me double-check the shift.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is actually 12 positions forward, not backward. In some Caesar ciphers, the shift direction might be different. Let's try shifting forward by 12 positions.\n\nUsing a forward shift of 12:\n\nA -> M\n\nB -> N\n\nC -> O\n\nD -> P\n\nE -> Q\n\nF -> R\n\nG -> S\n\nH -> T\n\nI -> U\n\nJ -> V\n\nK -> W\n\nL -> X\n\nM -> Y\n\nN -> Z\n\nO -> A\n\nP -> B\n\nQ -> C\n\nR -> D\n\nS -> E\n\nT -> F\n\nU -> G\n\nV -> H\n\nW -> I\n\nX -> J\n\nY -> K\n\nZ -> L\n\nApplying this to \"ruzpuzs bqmoq iuftuz\":\n\nR -> D\n\nU -> G\n\nZ -> L\n\nP -> B\n\nU -> G\n\nZ -> L\n\nS -> E\n\nSo, \"ruzpuzs\" -> \"dglbgle\"\n\nB -> N\n\nQ -> C\n\nM -> Y\n\nO -> A\n\nQ -> C\n\nSo, \"bqmoq\" -> \"n cyac\"\n\nI -> U\n\nF -> R\n\nU -> G\n\nT -> F\n\nU -> R\n\nZ -> L\n\nSo, \"iuftuz\" -> \"urgfl\"\n\nPutting it all together: \"dglbgle n cyac urgfl\"\n\nThis still doesn't make much sense. Perhaps I need to consider that the shift might be 12 positions in one direction, but perhaps it's more appropriate to shift backward by 12 positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ciphertext has some errors or additional characters.\n\nLet me try another approach. Perhaps the shift is not exactly 12 positions. Maybe it's a different shift value. But the prompt clearly says the shift is 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet is considered to be wrapping around. In Caesar ciphers, the alphabet is considered to be circular, so shifting beyond Z brings us back to A.\n\nLet me try decoding \"ruzpuzs bqmoq iuftuz\" with a shift of 12 positions backward again, carefully.\n\nUsing the backward shift table I created earlier:\n\nR -> H\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O\n\nP -> N\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O\n\nS -> I -> \"hknkoi\"\n\nB -> J\n\nQ -> G\n\nM -> C\n\nO -> E\n\nQ -> G -> \"jgcge\"\n\nI -> Y\n\nF -> L\n\nU -> K\n\nT -> J\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O -> \"y lkjo\"\n\nCombining them: \"hknkoi jgcge y lkjo\"\n\nThis still doesn't seem to make sense. Maybe the plaintext has some errors or is not in standard English.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not 12 positions, but the key is 12, meaning that each letter is shifted by 12 positions in a different direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 12 positions forward, not backward.\n\nWait, in Caesar ciphers, the direction of the shift can vary. Sometimes, shifting forward means adding the shift value, and shifting backward means subtracting it.\n\nLet me try shifting forward by 12 positions.\n\nUsing the forward shift:\n\nR -> D\n\nU -> G\n\nZ -> L\n\nP -> B\n\nU -> G\n\nZ -> L\n\nS -> E -> \"dglbgle\"\n\nB -> N\n\nQ -> C\n\nM -> Y\n\nO -> A\n\nQ -> C -> \"n cyac\"\n\nI -> U\n\nF -> R\n\nU -> G\n\nT -> F\n\nU -> R\n\nZ -> L -> \"urgfl\"\n\nCombining them: \"dglbgle n cyac urgfl\"\n\nStill doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 12 positions, but the alphabet is considered to be lowercase or uppercase only.\n\nWait, in the alphabet mapping, uppercase and lowercase letters are typically treated separately, but in a Caesar cipher, the case should be preserved or considered accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps non-alphabetic characters are preserved as is.\n\nBut in this ciphertext, all characters are letters, so that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift value is incorrect, but the prompt specifies a shift of 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ciphertext is incorrectly transcribed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plaintext is in a different language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a typo in the ciphertext.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the shift is not a simple Caesar shift, but some other type of substitution.\n\nBut the prompt specifies a Caesar cipher with a shift of 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is applied differently, such as shifting each letter by 12 positions but wrapping around the alphabet.\n\nWait, that's exactly how Caesar ciphers work.\n\nLet me try decoding each word separately.\n\nFirst word: \"ruzpuzs\"\n\nR -> H\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O\n\nP -> N\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O\n\nS -> I\n\nSo, \"hknkoi\"\n\nSecond word: \"bqmoq\"\n\nB -> J\n\nQ -> G\n\nM -> C\n\nO -> E\n\nQ -> G\n\nSo, \"jgcge\"\n\nThird part: \"i\"\n\nI -> Y\n\nFourth part: \"uftuz\"\n\nF -> L\n\nU -> K\n\nT -> J\n\nU -> K\n\nZ -> O\n\nSo, \"y lkjo\"\n\nCombining them: \"hknkoi jgcge y lkjo\"\n\nThis still doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spaces are incorrectly placed, and the actual plaintext is one continuous string.\n\nLet me try decoding the entire string without spaces:\n\n\"ruzpuzsbqmoqiuftuz\"\n\nDecoding with a shift of 12 backward:\n\nR->H\n\nU->K\n\nZ->O\n\nP->N\n\nU->K\n\nZ->O\n\nS->I\n\nB->J\n\nQ->G\n\nM->C\n\nO->E\n\nQ->G\n\nI->Y\n\nF->L\n\nU->K\n\nT->J\n\nU->K\n\nZ->O\n\nSo, \"hknkoijgcgey lkjo\"\n\nWhich is the same as before: \"hknkoi jgcge y lkjo\"\n\nStill doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is not 12, but the key is 12 in a different cipher system.\n\nBut the prompt specifies a Caesar cipher with a shift of 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the alphabet used is not the standard English alphabet, but includes other characters or has a different ordering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ciphertext is incorrectly provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plaintext is intentionally gibberish.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the shift is",

I'll decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, since the shift is 12, I'll be shifting back by 12 positions to get the original letters.\n\nI should also consider that the alphabet wraps around, so if I go past 'a' while shifting back, I'll loop back to 'z'. For example, shifting 'a' back by 12 positions would give 'm'.\n\nLet's start decoding each letter in the first word, \"fgdzuzs\".\n\n1. f -> shift back 12: f is the 6th letter. 6 - 12 = -6. Since it's negative, I'll add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet): -6 + 26 = 20, which is 'u'.\n\n2. g -> 7th letter. 7 - 12 = -5. -5 + 26 = 21, which is 'v'.\n\n3. d -> 4th letter. 4 - 12 = -8. -8 + 26 = 18, which is 'r'.\n\n4. z -> 26th letter. 26 - 12 = 14, which is 'n'.\n\n5. u -> 21st letter. 21 - 12 = 9, which is 'i'.\n\n6. z -> 26th letter. 26 - 12 = 14, which is 'n'.\n\n7. s -> 19th letter. 19 - 12 = 7, which is 'g'.\n\nSo, \"fgdzuzs\" decodes to \"uvrinng\".\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.

That still looks odd. Maybe I should consider that the shift might be different or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is 12 positions forward, not backward. Let's try shifting forward by 12 positions.\n\n1. f (6) +12=18 -> r\n\n2. g (7) +12=19 -> s\n\n3. d (4) +12=16 -> p\n\n4. z (26) +12=38 -> 38-26=12 -> l\n\n5. u (21) +12=33 -> 33-26=7 -> h\n\n6. z (26) +12=38 -> 38-26=12 -> l\n\n7. s (19) +12=31 -> 31-26=5 -> e\n\nSo, \"fgdzuzs\" becomes \"rsp lhle\".

Let's take the ciphertext \"zgdfgdq kagd dqxmfuazetube\" and decode it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the alphabet and how the shift works. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, since the shift is 12, I need to shift each letter back by 12 positions to get the original letter.\n\nI'll create a simple mapping for the alphabet to make this easier.

Since the alphabet has 26 letters, shifting back by 12 is equivalent to shifting forward by 14 positions (because 26 - 12 = 14).\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I'll stick to shifting back by 12 positions directly, considering the wrap-around.\n\nLet's decode each letter in the ciphertext \"zgdfgdq kagd dqxmfuazetube\":\n\n1. z -> shift back 12: z is the 26th letter. 26 - 12 = 14, which is n.\n\n2. g -> shift back 12: g is the 7th letter. 7 - 12 = -5.

Since we can't have negative positions, I'll add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) to get 15, which is O.\n\nX\n\nX is the 24th letter. 24 - 12 = 12, which is L.\n\nX again: 24 - 12 = 12, L.\n\nA: 1 - 12 = -11 + 26 = 15, O.\n\nI: 9th letter. 9 - 12 = -3 + 26 = 23, W.\n\nSo, \"raxxai\" decodes to \"follow\".\n\nWait, that seems like \"follow\", but spelled with two L's.\n\nNow, \"kagd\"\n\nK is 11th letter: 11 - 12 = -1 + 26 = 25, Y.\n\nA: 1 - 12 = -11 + 26 = 15, O.\n\nG: 7th letter: 7 - 12 = -5 + 26 = 21, U.\n\nD: 4th letter: 4 - 12 = -8 + 26 = 18, R.\n\nSo, \"kagd\" decodes to \"your\".\n\nFinally, \"tqmdf\"\n\nT: 20th letter: 20 - 12 = 8, H.\n\nQ: 17th letter: 17 - 12 = 5, E.\n\nM: 13th letter: 13 - 12 = 1, A.\n\nD: 4th letter: 4 - 12 = -8 + 26 = 18, R.\n\nF: 6th letter: 6 - 12 = -6 + 26 = 20, T.\n\nSo, \"tqmdf\" decodes to \"hear t\". Wait, that seems like \"heart\", but it's \"hear t\". Maybe I misdecoded the last letter.\n\nWait, F is 6th letter: 6 - 12 = -6 + 26 = 20, T.\n\nYes, so \"hear t\". Maybe it's \"heart\" with a space in between.\n\nPutting it all together: \"follow your heart\"\n\nSo, the plaintext is \"follow your heart\".\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{follow your heart}} \\]",
        "gold": "follow your heart"
